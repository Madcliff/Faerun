#Shadow Heist Quest;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_STH_1432;Greetings, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]. Soon, a great auction of magic items will take place in a realm not far from your base of operation. Do I need to say more?;;;;;;;;;;;x
#;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Get past the guards;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_STH_1433;It's the night before the auction.

#;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#You get caught;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_STH_1435_A;Your infiltration plan went well, at first. Then one of your adjutants messed up and accidentally broke something, a vase, perhaps? Regardless, that made a lot of noise. In less than a minute, you're surrounded by the auction house's guards. The city watch will also be here soon...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_STH_1435_B;Your team silently killed a few guards, but one managed to call for help. Now you find yourself facing overwhelming odds, as the auction house's guards and the city watch surround you...;;;;;;;;;;;x
