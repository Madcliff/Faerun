###Gods of Death/Undeath###
tp_myrkul;Temple of Bone;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_myrkul_desc;The worship of Myrkul, is often frought with mystery and necrotic tombs. Often times, these Mausoleums house the furtive priests of the Bone Lord, conducting black rituals of undeath to haunt their decrepit crypts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_kelemvor;Halls of the Damned;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_kelemvor_desc;The worship of Kelemvor, is the acceptance of deaths role. A far cry from the Myrkulites, Kelemvor teaches that death need not be feared, rushed, or delayed, simply accepted. A modest philosphy, temples to the Lord of Death often bring their own prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_jergal;Annals of the Dead;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_jergal_desc;Jergal was the first lord of the dead, or more accurately, "Lord of the End of Everything". Once God of Death, Strife, and Murder, he is now a shadow of his former glory. To Jergal, all life is temporary, an endless sea of chaos compared to the stability of deaths embrace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_velsharoon;Forsaken Crypt;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_velsharoon_desc;The Archmage of Necromancy, Velsharoon was once a mortal, but through foul rituals and arcane means, ascended to Divine status. Patron of Liches, Necromancers, and madmen alike, their creed espouses knowledge as power, and power above all. To worship such a deity is surely frought with peril.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_orcus;Lifes Bane;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_orcus_desc;The Prince of Undeath, once a Demon prince of the endless abyss, Orcus status as a divine is oft questioned, though his power is not. Seen as a shortcut to immortality by madmen, many would be vampires and liches follow the horned demon, regardless of the price. As such, only death and misery will follow.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Generics###
ca_bloodknights;Lords of the Night;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bloodknights_desc;Vampires, are by far the superior warrior. With the strength of an orc, the grace of an elf, and all the bestial hunger of a ghoul, few can truly match them in the field of battle. As such, a fine retinue of vampiric knights are always welcomed, though heavy is their price.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hauntedcastle;Cries of the Damned;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hauntedcastle_desc;Banshess, wights, spectres, and even shadows. Tormented souls filled with malicious intent and murderous desire for all things living. Often bound to the very brick and mortar of the castle, such spectral defenders oft obey the wishes of their Necromantic master.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_catacombs;Necrotic Legion;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_catacombs_desc;Cities are naturally more populous, and often have little land to properly bury their many dead. As such, many cities construct mass grave complexes to store the sheer number of bodies. Of course, if the city was ever besieged, a ruler of lesser piety could easily put the restless spirits to work...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bloodtax;The Blood Tax;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bloodtax_desc;Vampiric Lords are terrible tyrants ill-concerned over the fate of the peasantry. A decadent class of nobility, the streets of a vampiric city are often empty at night. Jails are seen as mere dining venues, and the populace is bled dry to feed the never ending appetite of pale monsters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_hauntedmansion;Haunted Mansion;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_hauntedmansion_desc;The manor of many elite and noble lords is frought with tales most grisly. Fiendish murders, twisted schemes, and black rituals deep within the mansion, are oft the tales of jealous peasants. Yet once in a while, the tales are close to reality. Foul necromancy has tainted this home, and only the malevolent will of the residing lord keeps it under check.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_graveyard_1;Graveyard;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_graveyard_1_desc;A small burial ground, once used by the local population to bury their dead, now used by undead masters to properly stash corpses before reanimation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_graveyard_2;Cemetery;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_graveyard_2_desc;A large burial ground, complete with crypts, mausoleums and other buildings designed for space-efficient burials, now used by undead masters to properly stash corpses before reanimation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_graveyard_3;Necropolis;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_graveyard_3_desc;A vast burial ground, complete with crypts, mausoleums and sprawling underground complexes, now used by undead masters to properly stash large amounts corpses before reanimation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
