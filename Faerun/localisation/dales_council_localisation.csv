#The society description;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dales_council_desc;The Dales Council was formed after the defeat of Aencar Burlisk, the self-proclaimed King of the Dales, in 1044 DR, when his campaign to unite the dales under one rule was ended. The Council allows the governments of the various dales to meet and debate issues affecting all of their lands. Each dale sends a delegate to the council to agree upon matters such as trade routes, foreign relations, defense pacts against Zhents or other aggressors, and various squabbles between neighboring dales.;;;;;;;;;;;x
