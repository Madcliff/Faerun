###Group wide, any tribal giant can build###
tb_rockthrow_1;Boulder Pit;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_1_desc;All giants, regardless of their origin, enjoy throwing mighty boulders. Sadly, this ruler has only a meagre pile of rocks to work with.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_2;Throwing Pitch;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_2_desc;This field is littered with craters and once-crimson stains. Here, all giants partake in their favorite past time, competing in games of strength, distance, and occasionally accuracy. It is not uncommon after a successful raid for captives to be made into moving targets or worse, ammo.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_3;Rock Range;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_3_desc;Booms and thunderous crashes can be heard miles away from this range, as teams of giants are drilled into the art of the throw. Each giant is trained to become a living siege weapon, for few castles could withstand such a barrage of stone from these warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_1;Straggling Nomads;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_1_desc;Though some of the oldest of giantkin can barely recall the legends of Ostoria, they still claim to be the rightful overlords of Faerûn. This is easier said than done when conquering desert terrain. Thankfully, a few enterprising nomads have come bearing goods.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_2;Nomad Outposts;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_2_desc;Giants as a rule require more food to sustain themselves than the small races. Even the smallest of giant populations require a king's feast every day, let alone those settled under the scorching desert sun. The few nomads have organized themselves, and come once a season with camels ladened with precious food.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_3;Nomad Quarters;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_3_desc;From the unruly hill giants to the thunderous storm giants, the nomads are begrudgingly welcomed. Some tribes even have special quarters fit to house them. During the off-season, these more settled nomads offer their services as cavalrymen, a rare role in any giant army.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_4;Nomadic City;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_desert_town_4_desc;It is undeniable that in this province, the once nomadic people of the desert have begun to coexist with their giant overlords. Older giants, those who recall the legends of Ostoria, remark that this is what it may have once been like. Regardless, this province provides not only food and shelter, but much wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giant_totem_1;Totem Pole;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giant_totem_1_desc;The Ordning is an integral part of giant society, regardless of specific race. Part of this highly stratified society is the worship of their ancestor god. Each giant breed is supposedly descendent from one of Annam's many sons. Here the tribe has erected a small shrine in honor of their patron.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_1;Shadowed Woods;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_1_desc;Voadkyn, or as they call themselves, 'Wood Giants' are the sons of Othea and Ulutiu. They are elusive, indifferent, and generally in the middle of giantkin society. They are not as fanatically opposed as the firbolgs, nor as zealoulsy devoted as the virbeeg. Nor do they hold a hatred for Annam, as fomorians do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_2;Guarded Glades;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_2_desc;Voadkyn are among the more friendly of the giantkin. Being peaceful neighbors for elven and fey folk, they are often described as the peaceful giants. This reputation, coupled with their soft history with true giants, allows them to act as much needed intermediaries with the great forest kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_3;Hedge Mazes;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_3_desc;What forms the basis of the Ordning for the voadkyn, is their sense of gardening. So famed is their skill, they have grown magical hedge gardens even as far as the frozen north.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_4;Treasure Gardens;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_woodgiant_4_desc;The curious nature of the voadkyn, as well as their general aloofness, has produced a great treasure. Legends speak of a great hoard of gold and gems, hidden deep within their magic gardens. True or not, the wood giants are not telling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_trollmarsh_1;Troll Nest;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_trollmarsh_1_desc;Trolls are perhaps the most hardy breed of creature on Faerûn, capable of adapting to any environment and becoming an apex predator. Most sane peoples will actively hunt down trolls and destroy their nests. However, most people are not true giants. It's not uncommon for trolls to be bullied by true giants to do their bidding.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_trollmarsh_2;Troll Warren;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_trollmarsh_2_desc;This giant overlord, whether mad or genius, has desired to let the troll population grow in this province. What mad purpose do they scheme for? The trolls instinctively worship Vaprak the Destroyer, and are not true sons of Annam.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogreslaves;Ogre Brutes;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogreslaves_desc;Ogres are often mistreated and disliked by many of the true giants. Some giants keep them as house servants or fieldhands on their estates, but the only ones who don't hold them apart are hill giants, so similar they are in culture. Still, dumb guards that won't disobey you are good enough for most warlords.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogreslaves_2;Ogre Thugs;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogreslaves_2_desc;A large collection of ogre mercenaries has assembled in the province. Poorly armed, poorly trained, and most of all, stupid, they are still able to kill anything smaller than them. A quality most giant overlords find good enough for the purpose of conducting war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ordninghill;Hill Giants;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ordninghill_desc;The Ordning is a powerful concept for the jotunbrud. The mightiest chief can be lower than the meekest member of a higher ranked tribe. As such, in the rare instances where two different tribes meet, the superior tribe is often able to command the lesser. This is no better displayed than with hill giants. Being the stupidest, shortest, and ugliest of true giants, they need little convincing to follow any giant above them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ordningstone;Stone Giants;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ordningstone_desc;The Ordning is a powerful concept for the jotunbrud. The mightiest chief can be lower than the meekest member of a higher ranked tribe. As such, in the rare instances where two different tribes meet, the superior tribe is often able to command the lesser. For stone giants, this often means serving as artisans, building and decorating the tribe's fortifications. A few occasionally serve as spiritual advisors for their new overlords.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Group wide, any castle giant can build###
ca_nomadcity;Nomad Quarters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_nomadcity_desc;Long have the desert nomads lived these lands, and longer still when the sands of time devour it all again. Through good trade, diplomacy, and simple fortune, the nomads have purchased free quarters to call their own. Now when the trade season starts, giants and nomad mingle within the walls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goblinlevy_1;Slave Levy;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goblinlevy_1_desc;These wretches have long since been enslaved by their giant overlord. Whether by force, or simply have given up, they fight as frontline skirmishers, and if needed, as meatshields.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goblinlevy_2;Slave Host;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goblinlevy_2_desc;Under the ogres whip, these warriors march into certain doom. Only the rough riders have a chance at ever living, or bold enough, to flee after the battle. The host knows only war and misery, under the giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_voadkyn;Wood Giant Foresters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_voadkyn_desc;The Wood Giants are a reclusive, insular race of giantkin. Born of Ulutiu and Othea's affair, they are in the middle when it comes to kin and jotunbrud relationships. It will take considerable gold to earn their trust, but if won, powerful allies are made available.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_voadkyn_2;Secret Glades;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_voadkyn_2_desc;The Voadykn are a dour people, but not in spirit. To them, nature and her bounty is a beautiful gift that must be protected. With a strong affinity for druidic magic, entire communities and tribes can be hidden inside of glades. Legends speak of the vast horde of gold hidden within said glades, but the wood giants are not telling otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_troll_den_1;Troll Den;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_troll_den_1_desc;The giant lord of this castle has housed a small tribe of trolls inside it's deepest dungeons. Dangerous even to true giants, trolls are still ruled by the strongest, but any question of loyalty can never be sure. They are the spawn of Vaprak, the Destroyer, a common enemy of the Ordning.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orcslaves_1;Orc Clan;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orcslaves_1_desc;It takes a lot of gold to make an Orc your friend. It takes a strong arm and more gold than a halflings weight to convince a clan to fight for you. Mercenary orcs are a clear distinction above their tribal cousins. Disciplined, well-equipped, and loyal as long as the gold comes, they are a professional fighting force many lords would desire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orcslaves_2;Clan Chiefs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orcslaves_2_desc;The clan has grown considerably. So much so, that distinctions have arose between them, and between Orcs, a clan difference is as wide as a halflings waist. For the giant lord, this means more troops, albeit quarrelsome ones, but professionals nonetheless. Just as long as the chiefs are given their proper due.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ordninghill;Hill Giants;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ordninghill_desc;The Ordning is a powerful concept for the jotunbrud. The mightiest chief can be lower than the meekest member of a higher ranked tribe. As such, in the rare instances where two different tribes meet, the superior tribe is often able to command the lesser. This is no better displayed than with hill giants. Being the stupidest, shortest, and ugliest of true giants, they need little convincing to follow any giant above them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ordningstone;Stone Giants;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ordningstone_desc;The Ordning is a powerful concept for the jotunbrud. The mightiest chief can be lower than the meekest member of a higher ranked tribe. As such, in the rare instances where two different tribes meet, the superior tribe is often able to command the lesser. For stone giants, this often means serving as artisans, decorating the tribes fortifications. A few occasionally serve as spiritual advisors for their new overlords.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Hill Giant Tribal###
tb_steading_1;Mud Hovels;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_1_desc;Hill giants are generally stupid, violent, and gluttonous. They do not build mighty fortresses, nor do they conduct much in the way of agriculture. Instead, they live a life of raiding, bullying, and habitual feasting, in that order. Thankfully, only a small tribe of them resides here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_2;Crude Steadings;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_2_desc;In rare cases, when hill giants are allowed to grow in population, they begin erecting crude steadings. Much like a house, save built for giant size, these steadings are often built around the chief's hall. This tribe has begun to dominate the region, and few things can stop them now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_3;Rough Camps;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_3_desc;Hill giants do not build with organized planning in mind. Unless the chief directly knocks it down, most giants build wherever they please. This is not the case here, as the disparate steadings have begun to form defensive rings, centered around the chief's hall and the growing wealth within.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_4;Hill Forts;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steading_4_desc;A mighty chieftain has cemented their power here. Among the hills and valleys, hillforts constructed from huge uprooted trees and immense boulders have emerged. Countless pens and huts for housing slaves and food animals surround these forts, at the center of which sit the chief's grand feast hall.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_1;Refuse Creeps;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_1_desc;Hill giants are a filthy race by nature. Their constant feasting, lack of cleanliness, and hardy bodies means very little truly bothers them. This filth attracts scavengers such as ghouls, slimes, and perhaps even an otyugh, forming a secondary ecosystem within the settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_2;Squalor Squatters;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_2_desc;As the tribe grows, so too does it's scavenger population. The giants are generally unbothered by these creatures, being too bothersome to be preyed on when endless scraps rain down from above. They do serve an unofficial purpose in keeping the tribe relatively clean, as well as slowing down attackers who don't expect to find packs of ghouls or family of otyugh.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_3;Trash Kings;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_monstertrash_3_desc;Though hill giants are not known for their husbandry or animal handling skills, they make up for this by enthusiastically bullying weaker creatures. Here the local chief has forced the various scavengers to serve the tribe, and developed simple tactics to deploy them in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_1;Chief's Tent;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_1_desc;Even the lowliest of hill giant chieftains ensures that they have the best hovel in the tribe. Even if that means it's just a few trees and hides tied to form a makeshift tent.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_2;Chief's House;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_2_desc;Finally, a proper roof over the chieftain's head has been erected, large enough to house their family and a few loyal guards. This up-and-coming chief still has a long way to go however.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_3;Chief's Hall;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_chiefshut_3_desc;From the squalid mud fields to a rightful lord's hall, this hill giant has built a home which is legitimately impressive to both smallfolk and giantkin. Fearsome beasts prowl around, trophies from distant battlefields decorate it's walls, and the raucous laughter of guests speaks of an ongoing feast.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_1;Loathsome Prisoners;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_1_desc;Out of all giantkin, hill giants are one of the few who actively hunt and eat smallfolk. Their ravenous hunger and lack of manners means they have no qualms when devouring such sapient creatures. Occasionally, a chieftain saves a few prisoners for more twisted purposes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_2;Rowdy Captives;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_2_desc;Hill giant tribes are often a conglomeration of other species. Bullying or enslaving the smaller races, it is not uncommon to see goblinoids, orcs, and humans toiling under their giant overlords. Rarely do such creatures live past a single generation, but a few eek out an existence through luck and canny understanding of giant culture.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_3;Broken Servants;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_3_desc;When the giants march to war, they endeavor to take as many prisoners as possible. This tribe in particular has kept a sizeable population under their leash, even going so far as to employ them in battle. Underfed, abused, and utterly cowed, these slaves are more on-site entertainment than a real threat.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_4;Chattel Slaves;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_pens_4_desc;This tribe has grown so powerful that whole tribes of humanoids have been enslaved under them. Despite the hunger, squalor and the semi-feral beasts that roam the settlement, these poor creatures live out generation after generation under the cruel giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_1;Ogre Slaves;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_1_desc;There exists a long and complicated history between the true sons of Annam, the all-father, and Vaprak the Destroyer. Ogres in particular are often bullied by the true giants, forced to be servants and camp guards. Still, they are tougher than regular humanoids, and share a similar enough culture with hill giants to be unbothered by this new lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_2;Ogre Guards;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_2_desc;In more populous tribes, hill giants often employ ogres to be guards and slave masters. The ogres only ask for food and shelter, which any repsectable giant tribe could provide. Questions of loyalty, and if the ogres worship Vaprak, enemy of the Ordning, are best left unasked.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_3;Ogre Clans;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_3_desc;Ogres are ferocious fighters, ever hungry, and warmongers by nature. Legends speak of the old armies of Ostoria, with legions of ogres and other giantkin following the thunderous march of the giants. Thus, even to this day it is not unusual to see small clans of ogres joining hill giant tribes as servants and warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_4;Ogre Tribe;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ogre_camp_4_desc;With the growth of the hill giants, this tribe of ogres has committed itself to their cause. Promised food and much booty, these warriors march at the pleasure of their overlord, wrecking and reaving across the land.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_1;Chef's Tent;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_1_desc;Ogres and hill giants are similar in culture, if not in stature. Both have a ravenous hunger, both have no qualms eating sapient creatures, and both think they are some of the greatest creatures on Faerûn. Their sense of superiority is often humbled, but nothing infuriates these creatures more than a meagre feast hall, or worse, no hall at all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_2;Cook's Kitchen;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_2_desc;Finally, the chieftain of this province has ordered the people to build a proper kitchen. Feeding an army is a monumental task, let alone feeding creatures that can eat cows whole. As long as this chieftain keeps the food coming, more warriors will come to the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_3;Mess Hall;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_3_desc;Entering this building as a smallfolk is a death sentence. Ravenous giantkin grab and eat anything within reach of their greasy hands, while mangy wolves and stranger creatures prowl for scraps under the table. A small army of cooks is kept busy slaughtering anything edible, and even the chieftain is busy gorging on fine meats. The warriors are without a doubt eager for battle, and flock to this mighty chief and their table.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_4;Smokehouse;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_feast_halls_4_desc;From across the hills and mountains, warriors large and hungry march forth simply to dine at this feast hall. Mutton-stuffed halflings, fine kebab elf, and juicy shepherd steaks are but the entrées for this never ending feast. Grolantor himself would weep to find such a banquet.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_1;Lone Tinkerers;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_1_desc;The more bestial races, such as ogres and hill giants, are not known for their craftmanship. Instead relying on the looted booty of other races, it has dawned on some members of their race to keep a tinkerer or two around.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_2;Grim Craftsmen;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_2_desc;Taken from the slave stock, these wretches have demonstrated some skill in creating and repairing armor. Chained to their shops, they'll spend all day hammering and smelting armor for their masters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_3;Bloody Smithy;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_3_desc;The hot forges and clang of hammer can be heard at all hours. Cruel ogre slave masters rule here with an iron hand. Given but the barest necessities to survive, these armorers and weaponsmiths work not just for fear of life, but what their overlords would do to their families.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_4;Sweat Shop;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_4_desc;This tribe marches with crude yet effective armor. Rough iron and belted trunks for shields, hammer heads the size of anvils, and swords the length of spears. This terrible host is fearsome indeed, for an armored giant is nigh unbeatable on the field of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_5;Dwarven Forges;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slave_shops_5_desc;Very rarely do hill giants get the opportunity to enslave dwarven prisoners. Not only do they rival fire giants in craft, and can find precious ore as well as stone giants, dwarves are unfortuneately smarter than hill giants to be caught. Yet here we are, and the wealth flows, thanks to dwarven labor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giant_totem_2;Mouth of Grolantor;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giant_totem_2_desc;A giant totem statue of Grolantor, the gluttonous god of the hill giants. Though not blessed with creativity or craftmanship, this idol is of the highest quality for hill giants. Here the priests tell stories of the ravenous god, imparting curious parables often involving feasting, eating, and hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_1;Fire Pit;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_1_desc;Here in the countryside is where hill giants thrive. And part of that is their surprising level of food storage. A Giant's storehouse is the most guarded building, rivaling it's chieftain and priest. Alas, this place has but only a common fire pit to roast local cows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_2;Larder;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_2_desc;As a culture dedicated to feasting, eating, and hunting, the preservation of food and cooking plays a heavy role. Gluttons, the ceremonial leaders of the tribe, are in charge of the food stores. The greater the stock, the larger the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_3;Cattle Pens;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_3_desc;Though infamous for it's raiding, the constant need to feast and stave off the hunger has led some intelligent giants to try herding. Often given to the elderly members of the tribe, their main duties are to fatten the cattle before the big feasts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_4;Pantry;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_storehouse_4_desc;A respectable pantry is filled to the brim with a tribes most exotic and choice meats. Griffins, lions, bears, and of course, humanoids. At times resembling a cruel zoo or prison, a giant's pantry is often times the most clean and organized out of the whole camp. A bastion of order in the tribes chaotic lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantdam_1;Giant Dam;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantdam_1_desc;Perhaps the one feat of engineering the hill giants can boast, is their characteristic attempt at creating massive damns on local rivers. The result of this is apparent, for the giants gain fresh water, richer fishing grounds, and dominance in the area by ransoming the water from those downstream.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_1;Goblin Wretches;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_1_desc;Only quite recently was this province ruled by an independent goblin tribe. The new giant overlords have decided that colonizing the province to be too expensive. They've instead begun the painful process of training these new found slaves into useful warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_2;Goblin Hunters;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_2_desc;One would think that giving your slaves bows and arrows a mistake. True for more typical slavers, but giants have little fear of being shot in the back, with armor as thick as an anvil for some, with skin as tough as rock for others. Not to mention the 'convincing' tactics the giants employ.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_3;Goblin Spearmen;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_3_desc;The weakness of giants is often apparent to anyone who sees them. Cut them down below the waist, and they'll fall. Though an individual giant can crush many humans at once, it is still vulnerable to lances and long axes. Thus the goblin spearmen encircle their overlord, offering both protection and killing power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_4;Goblin Rough Riders;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_goblinlevy_4_desc;Giant armies suffer from a rigid composition. Their warriors throw boulders for skirmishing, and later charge once the enemy closes in. Unsurprisingly, enemy armies have learned to rely on speed and maneuverability to avoid them in battle entirely. Thus enters the goblin rough riders. Their sole purpose is to chase and harass the enemy long enough for the giants to later crush them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stuffstuff_1;Stuff Stuff;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stuffstuff_1_desc;The smaller small folk, serve little to no purpose for the vicious hill giants. They are weaker than regular humanoids, constantly escaping, and in general steal from their proper overlords. However, hill giants have over the centuries developed a game based entirely around the smaller folk. Stuff stuff is a simple game, in which the winner is whoever can shove as many halflings or gnomes into their mouth. Giants of all ages enjoy the game, the soon to be dead small folk not so much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_1;Orc Grunts;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_1_desc;Orcs are fierce, territorial, and capable of being a threat to even ogre slave masters. As such, this province uses them sparingly, though a more daring chieftain may try to go further.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_2;Grumbling Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_2_desc;Compared to humans, elves, and other slaves, an orc is the ideal servant. Tribal by nature, with a culture respecting the strongest, as well as being capable of surviving the horrors of slavery, one must still be wary of them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_3;Mercenary Guards;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_3_desc;Orcs are better suited to fighting, than toiling away as slaves. Though to ensure loyalties, they are often paid in gold or a share of the loot. Effectively mercenaries, it does no good to point out the technical detail of who enslaved the other.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_4;Orc Commandos;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_orcslaves_4_desc;Given adequate arms, and even a place of respect in the tribe, Orcs are not incapable of allying with giants, just as ogres tend to do. Still, racial, cultural, and religious tension exists, with gold and booty being the only means of keeping the peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Hill Giant Castle###
ca_giant_steading;Stone Fort;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_desc;The hill giant chief of this land, grows bold enough to style themself civilized. Though the humans would laugh, and the elves would act insulted, no ruler could deny the fiercesome sight of this mighty stone castle. It's crude, roughshod appearance betrays the fact it houses an army of 15 foot warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_2;Pit Traps;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_2_desc;Beyond the immediate countryside, lays various pockmarked fields. Though not dangerous enough for giants, capable of stepping over them in a single bound, they are still deep enough to slow an invading army down.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_3;Boulder Traps;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_3_desc;Hill giant inginuity is often described as blunt. Surrounding the castle entrance, and the chiefs house, a giant need only roll one stone to cause the rest to fall. Time consuming to clean up for giants, death for anyone smaller.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_4;Dry Moat;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_4_desc;Acting as a crude latrine in times of peace, this rarely dry moat acts as a barrier for besiegers and any enemy army. Not necessarily advanced technology, but effective by hill giant reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_5;Starved Prophets;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_steading_5_desc;A Mouth of Grolantor is a paradox of hill giant society. Neither loved nor hated, these abused beasts are starved during times of peace, only to be unleashed as raging machines of death, consumed only with the desire to satiate their hunger or die trying. A last ditch effort, even for hill giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg;Strange Kin;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_desc;The Verbeeg are perhaps the most unnerving of kin tolerated in giant tribes. Spawn of Ulutiu, the destroyer of old Ostoria, these giant-kin are surprisingly amicable. Eager to please, quick-witted, and seemingly knowing too much. More suspicious giants warn of these strangers, but hill giants are sadly not the most wise of giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_2;Shifty Giants;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_2_desc;Verbeeg are notorious thieves, brigands, and speakers of half-truths. Yet despite this, they are strong proponents of the Ordning, offering their services from meagre hill giants to towering storm giants. Here the Verbeegs have made themselves a small enclave in the castle. Keeping to themselves, they whisper of things unpleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_3;Eyes of Karontor;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeeg_3_desc;The Elders warn of the Verbeeg. They speak of great underground kingdoms, ruled by the most cunning Verbeeg kings. That behind our back, they plot foul deeds against us all. Still, the eyes of Karontor are a small price to pay, for such excellent service. For now, they serve us.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields;Stomping Fields;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_desc;A field outside the castle dedicated to games of sport and exercise, for even hill giants understand the need for fun. Here is where the young compete, and the old teach, in all the fine details of boulder throwing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_2;Rock Ball;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_2_desc;The origins of rock ball are unknown. Perhaps learned from the various tribes of man and orc the giants have encountered, or one of giant origin, matters little. The game is one in which two teams of giants try to knock each other out with boulders. The team with no more players left standing loses.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_3;Strong Arm Competitions;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giant_fields_3_desc;In the odd day when Giants get bored of boulder throwing, they often try out different things. Tree sized javelins, cannonballs in cargo nets, and of course, log tossing. Though never as popular as the boulder, the exercise and novelty of it energizes them, making them better warriors for it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit;Dank Dungeons;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit_desc;Make no mistake, the tribal habits of the hill giants are still filthy. But instead of letting the vermin creatures roam free around the stone keep, they are kept in foul dungeons deep below. Waiting for the moment when their jailers will unleash them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit_2;Black Pit;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit_2_desc;A fortress of this size offers protection to many creatures. From hill giant warriors, humanoid slaves, and of course, that which lurks below. Kept in iron cages, and fed the scraps of the castle, they are starved and dangerous beasts. Many slaves are threatened merely by mention of the Pit.;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ca_monster_pit_3;Lurking Horrors;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_monster_pit_3_desc;Hill giants are not threatened by such creatures nor in serious danger. Capable of bullying these vermin as well as a human, they have amassed quite a collection here. Ropers, oytughs, oozes and slimes galore. A veritable monster zoo found here on Faerûn.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep;Lords Hall;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_desc;This hill giant is no mere chief. Gone are the tribal days of filth ridden huts and squalid mud hovels. A proper lords hall fit for an aspiring giant king. A rare sight of engineering for such a typically dumb race.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_2;Warrior Quarters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_2_desc;In this hall alone rests the chieftains finest warriors. From towering hill giants, to fierce ogre spearmen, they all stand by to guard their lord in both times of peace and war;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_3;Giant Armory;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giants_keep_3_desc;Inside this massive room is enough iron and steel to house an army, though just enough to arm a giant lords personal guard. Forged from the labor of slaves and prisoners, the weaponry is said by some cursed, while others believe it good fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery;Scruplous Traders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_desc;Hill giants offer little in terms of trade. They'll purchase food of course, but generally they offer little in terms of craft. That is of course, for civilized merchants. For those who deal in dark arts or foul schemes, the flesh trade is always profitable.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_2;Flesh Markets;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_2_desc;The giant lord has cleared a space inside the castle walls for a most unwholsome purpose. Ushered by brutal ogre guards, they parade forth from the castles dark heart. Merchants from far Calimsham and Zhentil Keep are here to do business;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_3;Slaver Chiefs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavery_3_desc;Dependent on the season, you could see the whole of Faerûn under these walls. Merchants of flesh, trading in wares exotic and foul. Whispers of demonic traders haunt the castle walls, yet the giant lord fears not. The gold is flowing through his walls, and into his coffers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe;Ogre Quarters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_desc;Hill giants are not the most cordial of their race, but of the ogres they feel a mutual understanding. Here in the castle, ogres are given their own quarters to train, arm, and prepare themselves for battle. In return they are given shelter under the giants roof, and a share of the loot.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_2;Runt's Armory;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_2_desc;Here is where the ogres are equipped with heavy spear and iron armor. Usually a wild and undisciplined mercenary force, now they are capable of surviving the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_3;Chief Ogres;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogretribe_3_desc;Typically, ogres are simply bossed and bullied by the giants into following orders. But after years of service and loyal dedication, the giant lord here has decided to grant further autonomy. Now they are led by a chief of their own choosing, they fight better, rarely breaking under pressure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_1;Reeky Fisherboats;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_1_desc;Hill giants are the last giants one would believe to be sailors. They lack intelligence, craft, and general interest in the water outside of seafood. Still, the giant lord demands his army capable of crossing any ocean. Ogres are given the lofty goal of building the ships, and manning them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_2;Wet Feet;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_2_desc;Despite all expectations, the hill giants are seaborn. Their ships are crude, often stolen, and one good hit away from sinking. Yet they are sturdy enough to ferry a few giants and their ogre slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_3;Creaky Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ogreshipyard_3_desc;Kings of the sea beware, the giants have amassed a flotilla of their own. Previously limited to wading across rivers and straits, they now sail the seas in immense galleys oared by ogres, rowing to the beat of the giant's drum. Truly both miracle and terror for Faerûn, as now the rapacious looters can now reach any shore, no mere body of water a barrier.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantdam_1;Giant Dam;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantdam_1_desc;Perhaps the one feat of engineering the hill giants can boast, is their characteristic attempt at creating massive dams on local rivers. The result of this is apparent, for the giants gain fresh water, richer fishing grounds, and dominance in the area by ransoming the water from those downstream.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_1;Herders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_1_desc;Giants are not quite expert shepherds, nor are they particularly skilled at husbandry. But a 15-foot giant can quite easily bully a cow like it's a runty goat. The smokehouses are some of the most culturally important buildings in hill giant society, and it is on mountains of steak that they feed upon when the winter comes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_2;Gatherers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_2_desc;Perhaps the closest to merchants for hill giant society, they endeavor to either purchase the food giants simply cannot hunt or herd. Of course, civilized merchants tend to make great profit off of the gluttonous beasts, for they care little about gold.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_3;Hunters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_3_desc;Though hill giants would eat anything, they still have certain tastes. Some prefer their meats raw, boiled, cooked, grilled, and even stewed. The many culinary tastes of the Hill giants is deceptive to outsiders, hence why hunters are tasked with the laborious task of gettng said meat in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_4;Hoarder;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_4_desc;Hoarders are mainly responsible for stocking and keeping the pantry organized, the one act of orderliness for such a messy race. Though the smokehouse itself is chaotic, behind every smokehouse is a well organized team of hoarders and fetchers to keep it running.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_5;Fetchers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantchef_5_desc;The title of Fetcher is not the most glorious position, yet it has much potential. Smokehouses are typically organized and ran by a Glutton, who often delegates the tedious work to his Fetchers. A powerful glutton will often have scores of Fetchers under him, with one or two poised to inherit the position of Glutton.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_1;Blood Fields;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_1_desc;While the slaves toil in the forges, those who have strong backs will work the fields. Though hill giants typically lack the patience for farming, they understand enough of it to force others to do it. With more slaves working the fields, the giants are free to take up arms for more glorious tasks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_2;House Staff;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_2_desc;The giant lord has determined a creature as powerful as him, needs as many servants to cater to his petty needs. Free from the horrors of the pit, the forge, and the fields, one would be mistaken to believe this is a better life. At any moment a servant may find themselves an impromptu snack by bored guards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_3;Surface Mines;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slavelabor_3_desc;Hill giants are not miners by nature. They can muscle themselves a cozy cave with a bit of effort, but generally know little of it's delicate details. A hill giant mine is perhaps the most dangerous and lethal mine in Faerûn, prone to cave ins, monster attacks, and the uncaring hunger of their own gaolers spell death for the miners.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_1;Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_1_desc;As proper for any respectable giant lord, this ruler has dedicated space in the castle for the worship of the giant gods. Giving praise to Annam, the all-father, the shrine is then divided between his family, in roughly equal praise. Here any giant, regardless of breed, can find time for worship.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_2a;Shrine to Ruk;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_2a_desc;Ruk, the terrestrial, the progenitor, King of all hill giants. Born of Annam's union between Othea the earth mother, Ruk is the traditional patron of hill giants. By dedicating this castle in his name, we attract more conservative giants, as well as performing maat, by honoring our ancestor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_2b;Shrine to Grolantor;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrine_2b_desc;Grolantor, god of gluttony, war, and hate in the giant pantheon. Born of Annam's union between the mother sky, he was once forbidden in interfering with the children of Othea. By dedicating this castle in his name, we attract warmongers and warriors, as well as earning glory by battling under his name.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_1;Thick Locks;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_1_desc;As one of the most important buildings in all of hill giant society, the pantry is heavily guarded. Not just from potential thieves, but from the ravenous and stupid hunger of it's own people. Only the Glutton and his trusted Hoarder have access to this building.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_2;Soaring Undercroft;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_2_desc;A dark, dank cellar, this room is gigantic, with vaulted walls reaching the size of small churches. This underground lair is where some of the most prized ingredients are stored, brought out only on holy feast days.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_3;Enormous Brewhouse;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_3_desc;The art of brewing is not entirely lost on hill giants. Though it'll never compete with dwarven ale, or elven wine, a giants beer, or jotunbrew, is strong enough to kill a bull twice over. Usually brewed by one of the Gourmands, the giants will often drink barrels of it during feast days.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_4;Cheese Cave;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_4_desc;Hill giants enjoy good cheese, if not more than any race. As such, within their pantries you'll be hard pressed to find dishes without it. The only trouble is that when left to forment for too long, pesky cheese molds begin to gain sapience. Many a hapless slave has been devoured by the cheesey beast.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_5;Gourmands House;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantpantry_5_desc;As chief cook for the castles garrison, the gourmand is an often thankless job. Still, it is a position with perks. Often gaining respectable size in their tribe, gourmands often times become a lesser noble with their impressive bulk. Still, when the tribe is on the move, the gourmand must follow, and with him a small army of under cooks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantdam_1;Giant Dam;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantdam_1_desc;Perhaps the one feat of engineering the hill giants can boast, is their characteristic attempt at creating massive damns on local rivers. The result of this is apparent, for the giants gain fresh water, richer fishing grounds, and dominance in the area by ransoming the water from those downstream.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_1;Stuff Stuff;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_1_desc;The smaller small folk serve little to no purpose for the vicious hill giants. They are weaker than regular humanoids, constantly escaping, and in general steal from their proper overlords. However, hill giants have over the centuries developed a game based entirely around the smaller folk. Stuff stuff is a simple game, in which the winner is whoever can shove as many halflings or gnomes into their mouth. Giants of all ages enjoy the game, the soon-to-be-dead small folk not so much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_2;Halffoot Ball;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_2_desc;Invented by an enterprising ogre named Joh Mad, this game is played with live shortfolk as the ball, as two teams of hill giants (or ogres) try to take the "ball" to a goal post usually across the field. A newly made sport, giants everywhere cheer at the spectacle of seeing players chase after the ball as it tries to escape. The balls coincidentally need constant replacing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_3;Fullfoot Ball;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stuffstuff_3_desc;Hailing from the southern lands, as far as Zakhara and Maztica, this variant of halfoot ball requires the players to kick the ball across the field, instead of carrying it. This sport quickly runs out of balls, but the fans love it nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Hill Giant City###
ct_cattleking;Stray Cows;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_desc;Hill giants are not experts at herding cattle, but strong rope and a good crook (giant sized of course) can go a long way. A Hill giant is tending his cows, with a few servants attending as assistants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_2;Runty Flock;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_2_desc;The Hoarder Chief demands much, and it's up to the lowly herders to answer his demands. A small herd of cattle can be seen out in the fields, but the servants outnumber them greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_3;Meagre Herd;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_3_desc;A large number of cows can be seen grazing, enjoying the peaceful watch of their giant herders. Enough for any baron, a small amount to feed a giant ruled city however.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_4;Modest Stampede;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_4_desc;With the blow of his horn, the herder chief summons his servants for the cattle march. Any fool careless enough to come near the herd will usually be crushed by boulders, or worse, trampled.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_5;Roving Hoofs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_5_desc;The land surrounding the city is often a minefield of droppings. These droppings usually attract vermin, which in turn attract predators. The herder chief must be on constant alert, for threats as minor as goblin poachers, to herd killing threats like Rocs and Dragons.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_6;Cattle King;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cattleking_6_desc;This herder chief has now become a Cattle King, a great title amidst civilized giant society. His herd boasts mighty bulls, hefty heifers, and enough giant drovers and stockers to rival a small army.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_1;Sleepy Eyes;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_1_desc;Hill giants are perhaps the worst guards, if not for their size and strength. Though often employed by their superior brothers, in those scenarios they are often drilled into disciplined warriors. For other hill giants, they tend to shirk responsibility. Still, a giant guard is worth at least ten men, so all is not lost.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_2;Grumbling Bellies;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_2_desc;In hill giant society, feasting, gorging, eating, indulging, etc, are all part of their daily life. If they're not eating, a hill giant is often unfocused. Sadly, this means guard duty is some of the most despised line of work, as there is little time for snacks. Still, giant guards will still defend buildings of worth, such as the pantry and feast hall zealoulsy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_3;Idle Hands;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantguards_3_desc;It is not uncommon to catch hill giant guards competing in games. Too dumb for sophisticated card games, the brutes prefer rolling dice, arm wrestling and tormenting whatever poor servant walks by.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_1;Great Stomping;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_1_desc;Hill giant cities, rare as they are, typically are conquered from other races. As most citizens of the old regime are enslaved, eaten, or driven off, what is left is useless buildings too small for the Giants to use. What is left after a "great stomping" is used to house their many servants and slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_2;Mad Traders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_2_desc;You may ask, who possibly visits a city ruled by hill giants? They offer little in trade, create nothing, and are generally hostile to all smaller people. Such dens of filth are usually visited by other hill giants, who usually bring chests and barrels of spoils, such as gold, jewelry, and unusable armor. In short, desperate and mad merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_3;Shoddy Walls;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_3_desc;Walls as humans build them, are little barriers for giants. When giants build walls, even dumb hill giants understand the concept of bigger is better. A mix of hard rock and logs stacked as high as possible, a hill giant city is a crude, rude, and ugly thing, but effective.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_4;The Big city;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantarsenal_4_desc;After many years, the servants and slaves of the Hoarder chief, have rebuilt a portion of this city. Though never as grand as what it was, or could be, this city has finally adapted to their new overlords, with streets large enough for both species to traverse, and shops tall enough to admit giant customers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_1;Master Gourmand;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_1_desc;The Hoarder chief has hired a Master Gourmand, one capable of cooking the finest meats and dishes. Of course, hill giants have little taste or culinary skill as humans know it. Regardless, a Gourmand is a chef of the highest skill, and brings with him much prestige, and if lucky, a loyal following.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_2;Cooks Entourage;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_2_desc;For good or ill, the Gourmand has attracted many competitors to the city, and with it a slew of lesser cooks. This increase in quality food, has near doubled the original population of the city. Many warriors it seems, have come to this land of culinary skill.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_3;Hells Kitchen;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_3_desc;The market square is bustling with traders, each eager to part with valuable ingredients such as manticore steaks, myconid portbellos, and even gorgon chops. The issue however is that many of these fine ingredients are still very much alive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_4;Gourmet Dining;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gourmands_4_desc;With the ever increasing demand for more and more food, especially of higher taste, many of the rivaling Gourmands have put aside their differences to establish their very own school. Trained in the culinary arts, these Gourmands now train young Gourmets, in the art of fine dining. Perhaps one day, the hill Giants can make a dish palpable for human consumption.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_1;Bloody Spears;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_1_desc;An ogre tribe has not only allied itself with the Hoarder chief, but has settled within the walls of the city. Ogres tend to follow the strongest, and are easily bribed. Thus it comes as no surprise they help police the city, as well as serve as the occasional slavemaster.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_2;Rude Skirmishers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_2_desc;Dressed in little to no armor, these ogres mainly focus on keeping the enemy far away, while the giants crush them with boulders. Inferior to say, an Elven unit, these are still hardy soldiers, capable of throwing heavy bullets with their slings, as well as chucking mighty spears before the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_3;Poor Marksmen;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_3_desc;Ogres are perhaps the worse bowman ever hired to serve an army. How they make up for this, is with the sheer size of their bow. Capable of drawing a bow twice the size of a man, they are capable of shooting in the vague direction of the enemy, while the sheer size of the arrow is enough to skewer some poor fool.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_4;Rugged Unit;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogretribes_4_desc;A motley crew of mercenaries, this tribe of ogres have produced a fine company of warriors, skilled enough in spear, bow, and mace. Perfect for bullying the smaller races, as well as marching into battle for the Hoarder Chief.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_1;Ghostly Stalls;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_1_desc;It was but only recently that this city was populated by civilized, neat, and upstanding citizens. But then the hill giants came, with their boulders, clubs, and feral beasts of war. As no surprise, the once bustling market is empty, save for guards on a punitive watch.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_2;Spooked Peddlers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_2_desc;The Hoarder chief has open the city up again for trade. To no ones shock, the market is still empty. Of course, a few merchants do come, but since the hill giants only ever purchase food, little profit yet exists to attract the flow of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_3;Bold Mongers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_3_desc;The markets once again host merchants, though this variety is of ill repute. Hailing from far Zhentil keep, these traders bring weapons and slaves. Hill giants, unphased by such dealings, are eager to do business.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_4;Nervous Traders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_4_desc;Hill giant society cares little for what civilized merchants usually offer. But where hill giants dwell, there are occasional servants and slaves who squirrel enough gold for the odd purchase. The market guards, bored and uninterested hill giants, don't stop slaves from entering the market. This is normally fine, but such lax security leads to occasional muggings and daylight robbery.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_5;Unhappy Merchants;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantmarket_5_desc;The Hoarder chief has, over time, earned a fair enough reputation for business. The merchants who do come to the city are either heavily armed, surrounded by guards, or powerful enough to slay giants outright. The marketplace therefore is quiet, dour, and tense during trade. The giant guards who stand watch, are more to establish authority, than to actually help poor merchants who comes under a rivals wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_1;Shadow Port;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_1_desc;A sea port is a dangerous, seedy place in the best of cities. For a hill giant ruled one, the port is practically under anarchy, with few ships daring to land unless heavily armed. As such, the Hoarder chief has ordered his ogres to guard the port, and keep the peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_2;Burly Steves;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_2_desc;The labor of an ogre, if properly placated, is twice that of an average man. Though not the most gallant stevedore, an ogre is more than capable of loading cargo into ships.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_3;Rowdy Marines;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ogreport_3_desc;Ogres are riotous, contentious, and generally smelly. Thus they are perfect sailors. Offering their services to more savage sea captains, ogre marines can hoist cannons, load cargo, and slaughter boarding pirates. As long as they are fed, the sailors life is little different from the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_1;Reeky Fisherboats;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_1_desc;Hill giants are the last giants one would believe to be sailors. They lack intelligence, craft, and general interest in the water outside of seafood. Still, the Hoarder chief demands his army capable of crossing any ocean. Ogres are given the lofty goal of building the ships, and manning them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_2;Wet Feet;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_2_desc;Despite all expectations, the hill giants are seaborn. Their ships are crude, often stolen, and one good hit away from sinking. Yet they are sturdy enough to ferry a few giants and their ogre guards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_3;Creaky Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantshipyard_3_desc;Kings of the sea beware, the giants have amassed a flotilla of their own. Previously limited to wading across rivers and straits, they now sail the seas in immense galleys oared by ogres, rowing to the beat of the giant's drum. Truly both miracle and terror for Faerûn, as now the rapacious looters can now reach any shore, no mere body of water a barrier.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_1;Giant Temple;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_1_desc;Despite all appearances, hill giants, like their brothers, are deeply religious. Granted the constant feasting, raiding, and general slavery of smaller races, it is hard to believe. In this massive log temple, giants of all breeds can give worship to mighty Annam, the all father.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_2;Shrine to the Ancestors;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_2_desc;There is a distinct line of theology that all giants understand. The gods of their pantheon, the celestial sons of Annam, and the ancestors, the terrestrial sons of Annam. In this shrine, the giants give worship to their sacred forefathers. For any giant, they must be able to recite their family line, all the way back to Annam.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_3;Shrine to the Gods;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_gianttemple_3_desc;Annam had many children, some legitimate, others not so much. Regardless, every member of Annam's house is respected under this shrine. From mighty Stronmaus, to little Iallanis, the only distinction is between those few members ousted from the pantheon. Of those, few giants give actual praise, and often in secret.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg;Criminal Families;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_desc;Verbeeg are shifty, sneaky, and general grifters in Giant society. Abhoring the concept of private property, and strangely zealous of the Ordning, they are a polarizing race for sure. And as this city has fallen to Giant hands, it was only a matter of time for a Verbeeg clan to come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_2;Strong Arm Thugs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_2_desc;Verbeeg stand almost near the bottom in the Ordning, a step above humans depending on which Giant you ask. As such, the Verbeeg hold a curious stance on the Ordning. Whereas Firbolgs abandon it wholeheartedly, and Voadkyn avoid it as much as possible, they embrace it despite their low stature.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_3;Notorious Narcs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_3_desc;The way Verbeeg's Ordning is structured, favors intelligence, cunninng and general skill in subterfuge. The only way to rise in their society is to outwit and defeat their superiors. Such skullduggery, as well as rumors of worshipping Karontor, the Twisted, gives ample reason for any giant to distrust these lesser kin.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_4;Eyes of Karontor;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_verbeeg_4_desc;Karontor the Twisted, is a long since banished deity of the Ordning. It is said that Karontor is evil first, anything else second. A spiteful, envious deity, he primarily associates with Verbeeg and Fomorians, offering them magic, patronage, and occasional wisdom. At this point, the local Verbeeg population is too strong to oust, as we have unwittingly let Karontors eyes in our city.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_1;Guarded Workshops;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_1_desc;Most of hill giant society is too busy focused on getting their next meal, let alone in the art of crafting the necessary tools that keeps a city running. Therefore the Hoarder chief has declared huge warehouse be occupied with slaves, to mass produce the many arms and armor for his army.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_2;Regimented Hours;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_2_desc;All across the warehouse floor, slaves toil to the beat of the giant's drum. Ogres brandishing cruel whips and barbs, keenly look for any dereliction of duty, however tiny. The slaves are worked long hours, and when the bell rings, they're ushered out, only for the next, fresher batch to take their place. Creating a never ending shift to produce the Hoarder chiefs weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_3;Ogre Bosses;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_slaveshops_3_desc;By maximising synergy between the ogre's whip and the slaves back, our CTO (Chief Torturer Ogre) predicts a ten-fold increase in weapon production. As we speak, we have commenced implementing new ergonomic designs. Instead of chaining the slave to the workstation, they're instead chained to the slave next to them. This ensures easy changeovers when it's time to rotate in a new crop of workers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry;The Giant's Pantry;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_desc;Save for their temple, a pantry is one of the most sacred buildings for hill giants, perhaps rivaled by the feast hall itself. When hill giants conquer a city, if not pillaged to the last stone, can easily become the greatest pantry of all. But for now there's just a respectable one here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_2;Loyal Spencers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_2_desc;Hill giants do not typically rule or occupy cities. Their society is primarily tribal, with but a few ambitious chieftains holding castles. To own a city, fundamentally changes their way of life. Yet, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Now the Hoarder chief has created a new system of titles, such as Spencers, whose job it is to manage the various mini pantry rooms adjacent to the main one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_3;Buttery Butlers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_3_desc;In a city so large, even one hosting hill giants, the need for specialized roles soon develop. The Buttery butlers are in charge of keeping the Hoarder chiefs special pantry stocked with butter, as well as wines and liquor. Comparable to a human nobles passion for cheese and crackers, the Hoarder chief enjoys fine butter and wine with his meals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_4;Hanging Meat Garden;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_4_desc;This special room is where all the various meats are hanged, cured, and occasionaly dried. Delivered straight from the chief butcher, the sight can be quite horrifying for the uninitiated, given that hill giants typically dine on humans.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_5;Skulking Scullery;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_5_desc;You'd be surprised at how much water is needed to wash a giant size plate, let alone make it hygienic. City giants are typically different from their tribal cousins in the fact that they don't eat with their bare hands. Yes, they do prefer pitchforks and and a good sword to cut their food. Rumors of the far eastern varierty using sticks to eat is of course preposterous.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_6;Cooler Cellar;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantpantry_6_desc;A great underground dungeon filled to the brim with ice elementals. How the hill giants did this incredible feat of magical summoning, let alone restrain them, is a mystery. Perhaps they petitioned their frost giant brothers, a local wizard was paid heavily, or some other means. Regardless, now the Hoarder chief and his family enjoy iced drinks and frozen treats all year round.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_1;Giant Dam;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_1_desc;Behold the greatest engineering achievement of the hill giants. By throwing enough logs and mud, they are able to dam up any river or local lake. The result is anyone downstream losing access to precious water, fish, and angry giants upstream demanding tribute.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_2;Fisher Huts;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_2_desc;With the large lake forming around the dam, there are a few hill giants who've taken to fishing. Some are not the brightest, wading in the water and splashing around trying to catch them by hand. Still, for some, simply sitting by the water getting drunk and pulling in a net with the daily catch is quite the high life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_3;Netter Stations;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_3_desc;It didn't take long for the hill giants to figure out the easiest and simplest way to fish. By setting up large stations in the water with their nets, they need only wade out and pull in the catch. Truly the pinnacle of fishermen.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_4;Deadliest Catch;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantdam_4_desc;For the few hill giants who've taken to fishing, there are some who crave a bit more excitement. Typically these are the ones who enjoy raiding and plundering, thus incorporate it into their hobby. These brave fools actively comb the waters for dangerous sea life. Serpents, sea elfs, kuo toa, and the occasional sahuagin. Foolish or not, they say the food tastes better.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###STONE GIANT Tribal###
tb_grotto;Open Recess;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_desc;Stone giants are not as tolerant of the surface world as their brothers. Spending most of their lives under darkness or the evening sun, they are at best described as awkward. Here this tribe has established itself inside of a small recess, dug out by hand. Mound walls surround the camp, with the odd tree and boulder if needed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_2;Sinking Camp;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_2_desc;The stone giants have begun the arduous task of digging out hollow chambers under the main camp. Used as storage, sleeping quarters, and occasional recreation. Though distinct from dwarves, stone giants are some of the best miners of the jotunbrud, going through hard rock as if it were soft clay. Still, it's a time consuming task best left for others.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_3;Deep Cavity;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_3_desc;Though far away from the underdark, stone giants believe zealously in building vertically, as opposed to the more human sprawl. With rooms large enough to house giants, the tribe has begun to move further down, leaving the undesirables to watch the main camp from the surface.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_4;Hollow Hills;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_4_desc;For stone giants, hilly terrain is quite preferable to the dreamlike expanse of the open plain, or worse, steppe. Enjoying the various nooks and cracks found in the rough countryside, the camp has entirely gone underground. It's only sign of activity is the pre-existing surface defenses.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_5;Cavern Homes;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_5_desc;Like halflings or dwarves, stone giants are only truly comfortable when deep in the embrace of the earth. Here, little to no creatures bother them, so far they are below the surface. While not truly in the underdark, these subterranean beings enjoy all the benefits of their insular lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_6;Mountain Grottos;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_grotto_6_desc;In the heart of the mountain, true giant friends will find beautiful gardens full of rock carvings, statues, and murals. For a race so dedicated to privacy, they excel in creating truly meditative places. These grottos lay miles below the surface, guarded by twisting passages, devious traps, and of course, mighty stone giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantfriends;Local Farmers;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantfriends_desc;Like all giants, stone giants prefer small folk to leave them alone. As such, they rarely interact with them, though there is one universal constant that keeps these two races in contact. Food is a scarce commodity, and though stone giants can feed themselves, it's much easier to trade away useless gold and gems to refill their stock.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantfriends_2;Happy Merchants;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantfriends_2_desc;Stone giants live an austere and near spartan lifestyle. Though they excel in creative works, from stone cutting, poetry, and even smithing, they rarely treat themselves. Preferring simple tunics, bare mats, and other essentials, it is hard to find things to trade for. Merchants however can always find ways to part gold and other gems from the giants by offering knowledge. Books, scrolls, and even poems depending on how rare.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantfriends_3;Giant Friends;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_giantfriends_3_desc;There are few people who can ever call themselves giant friends. Still, these extraodinary individuals are those trusted by the giant tribe to do fair dealings. These adventurous merchants enjoy the luxury of cheap goods, a safe roof, and little to no crossing tax when coming into giant lands. Often earned by performing some great favor for the tribe, such as slaying a dragon, hunting down thieves, and or returning lost artefacts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stonegiantfort;Earth Walls;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stonegiantfort_desc;Gone are the large mounds of dirt that surrounded the camp. Though not the most complex structure, these Earthy walls are hard as rock, smoothed out by magicals means known to the giants. As tall as four houses stacked on top of each other, the walls are manned by the typical dullards of the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stonegiantfort_2;Runic Defense;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stonegiantfort_2_desc;Though not as potent as other magics, the runes carved onto the walls are strong enough to stop a charging Auroch, as well as other devious effects. Such things as stability, protective charms, and of course alarm runes, to name a few positive ones.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stonegiantfort_3;Pit Falls;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stonegiantfort_3_desc;Everything a stone giant does, is in pursuit of art. As such, even something as typically crude as traps must be elegant. The pit fall traps of stone giants are often concealed, and when fallen into, transports the victim down a long chute into a suitably gruesome end. Typically a chamber far below the earth filled with oozes, ghouls, or simply a drowning chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stonegiantfort_4;Sentinel Dead;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stonegiantfort_4_desc;For some warriors of the tribe, death is not the end. Intentionally forsaking the Linjenstein, they instead mold into the very walls of the camp. When the priest or shaman calls for it, the quasi dead are stirred to life as near unbreakable stone constructs. A heavily maat act, such warriors are truly revered for their sacrifice, the equivalent of a human forsaking heaven for hell.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneships;Landlubbers;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneships_desc;Stone giants, as you can imagine, are not sailors. They actively avoid water, couldn't swim if their lives depended on it, and of course cannot breathe underwater like storm giants. Any attempt at taking to the sea must be purchased, either from experts like frost giants, or small folk if the need is truly dire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneherders;Bleating Goats;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneherders_desc;Herding is an unglorious task reserved solely for the brutes and fools of stone giant society. As such, while the masters are toiling on their great work deep below the earth, goats are bleating in the ear of the local tough.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneherders_2;Oversized Swine;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneherders_2_desc;Pigs are perhaps the most revolting possible creature to stone giants. Filthy, unseemly, and as gluttonous as a hill giant. As such, no respectable stone giant touches these foul swine. Such jobs are left for the simple herders.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneherders_3;Obnoxious Cows;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneherders_3_desc;Watching cows graze open fields is an often uninspiring task. Though the tribe benefits greatly from the meat and milk from the beasts, the task is still unseemly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneherders_4;Giant Barns;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneherders_4_desc;A building both above and below ground, the barn houses the whole tribes livestock. Divided into sections, the various animals are segregated by species, age, and gender. Though not experts in the cold practice of husbandry and general stewarding, the stone giants can certainly carve out corrals and pens for the various animals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_artshops;Carvers Cave;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_artshops_desc;Though a humble cave, here is where one of the masters of carving resides. Stone carving is one of the most sacred arts to the stone giants, believed to be Skoraeous gift to the giants. Thus only the best stone carvers lead the tribe, believing that within their hands, is the hands of their God.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_artshops_2;Chiselers Cove;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_artshops_2_desc;Though not the most prestigious, chiseling is an important part of writing for the stone giants. Chiseling small pictographs and runes, a master can expertly tell a story of life, death, and it's tragedy in but a few symbols. This forms the bulk of their "literature" though any non-giant would struggle to understand it's alien mode of thought.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_artshops_3;Orators Gallery;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_artshops_3_desc;Stone giants are a mostly quiet, and dour folk. When a tribe is sufficiently underground, they'd rarely mingle or conversate when there's work to be done. Still, the pursuit of art has led to a subculture of critics, and their need for proper oration. Here is the only room where the sound of chiseling, stone cracking or animals are not heard. Instead giants practice the art of speaking, and communicating esoteric concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_artshops_4;Warriors Dance;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_artshops_4_desc;To the stone giants, combat is a martial art in of itself. Though rarely practiced by more wizened giants, it is heavily encouraged for youngsters to perform. Every swing, every strike, and every movement is practiced as if it were a dance. Questions of it's proper combat effectiveness is rarely asked. A club is still a club, especially swung by creatures the size of small houses.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_4;Missile Strikes;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_rockthrow_4_desc;Where other giants practice merely chucking rocks, stone giants take the practice as seriously as their art. From the twist of the body, the pivot of the foot, to an athletic spin, the boulder can be aimed as expertly as a halfling with a sling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ancestorsroom;Hall of the Dead;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ancestorsroom_desc;Death comes for all creatures, even such a long lived race as the giants. To the stone giants, death is a mystical concept, for such a secretive and insular people. When one of their own passes from violent or foul causes, they store the body in alcoves within their underground halls. Their physiology allows their bodies to harden to stone, even merging with the very earth itself. As such, exploring the underground halls of stone giants is often an eerie experience.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ancestorsroom_2;Chamber of Spirits;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ancestorsroom_2_desc;In rare cases where the body of a stone giant is lost, or unreachable, the tribe erects a monument within the chamber of spirits. Often a statue made in the likeness of the lost, or for less famous ones, a mural effigy, this disturbing room houses lifelike statues mimicking the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ancestorsroom_3;Ancestors of Stone;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ancestorsroom_3_desc;The most sacred room to all stone giants, the Linjenstein, wherever a tribe resides, they'll construct this holy room. Here is where this ancient race gracefully store their elders. For when a stone giant nears the end of their long life, their bodies begin the petrification process. Movements become difficult, eating and drinking is painful, and worse of all is the loss of thought. When their time is nigh, an elder will sit in meditation, awaiting the end. Soon, they'll become nothing more than a statue, amongst hundreds.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mountainfort;Bat Colony;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mountainfort_desc;As the tribe delves deeper into the mountain, most of the upper to surface buildings begin to become abandoned. Rather than let such rooms go to waste, stone giants typically allow bat colonies to settle in these rooms. The bats of course benefit from this the most, but what the giants get is an alarm system, if any thief dares to go too deep.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mountainfort_2;Bear Dens;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mountainfort_2_desc;Most stone giants are not great animal masters, let alone know the druidic tongue. Still, to a giant, bears are as dangerous as a raccon is for a man. As such, the upper chambers of a tribe is given over to these deadly yet cuddly creatures. As far the bears are concerned, it's an agreeable situation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mountainfort_3;Labryinth Entrance;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mountainfort_3_desc;As a stone giant needs no light to see in the dark, can blend quite easily with stoney environs, and can tunnel as good as an umber hulk, the entrance to a tribes mountain home is lethal. The tunnels are often guarded by stealthy giants, as well as the tunnels themselves designed as a labryinth with no light source for miles. Truly, only fools would enter such a trap.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mountainfort_4;Roc Nest;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mountainfort_4_desc;Perhaps the mightiest of all creatures a giant can befriend, the Roc is a gargantuan bird capable of seizing whole elephants in a single scoop. How and when the giants learned to tame such monstrous beasts is unknown. Still, legends speak of the great Ostorian armies taking the battle to the sky, on mighty Roc steeds they flew.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneshrooms;Dank Cave;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneshrooms_desc;Did you know, that stone giants eat cave mushrooms raw? Claimed by the Patrons and Ponderers of stone giant society to be sources of great artistic inspiration, it is best to always be cautious when eating at a giant feast. What is a pleasant "mind enhancer" for a giant is lethal to mere humanoids.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneshrooms_2;Moist Cavern;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneshrooms_2_desc;Here is where most of the stone giants cultivate cave mushrooms. Experts at digging, the room is quite complex, with small channels of water and little waterfalls creating a moist and humid air about the room. As well as the general lack of sunlight, the giants can easily grow new and strange strains of mushrooms.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneshrooms_3;Mushroom Grove;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_stoneshrooms_3_desc;Of course, even in agriculture do the stone giants seek to create art. Here the room is both functional, and quite pleasing. Light mists of water, gentle sounds of a stream flowing, and various giant mushrooms shining beautifully under careful cave lighting. Rumors of myconids occasionally roaming the grove are unfounded of course. They're eaten well before they can walk.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###STONE GIANT Castle###
ca_stonewalls;Rock Walls;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonewalls_desc;The stone giants, if given enough quality material, can shape the very rock into any design. When a tribe has grown large enough to warrant it, mighty rock walls are raised around the camps entrance. Though the giants do not enjoy the surface world, they still understand the need for defending themselves when circumstances force them there.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonewalls_2;Runic Defence;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonewalls_2_desc;Only the runecasters have the power to infuse magic into the runes, and as such the tribe has paid heavily for a visiting runecaster. The result is nothing short of stunning, as now the very walls surrounding the camp glow bright with potent magic. Untold power flows through the very rock, easily repulsing any beast or brigand.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonewalls_3;Sentinel Dead;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonewalls_3_desc;Death is a serious matter for stone giants, as they live for centuries before ever feeling the weariness of age. Still, when the time comes, their bodies undergo the terrible petrification process. The tribes warriors, wishing to fight eternally in their prime, have opted to induce the petrification process, and become one with the very walls of the castle. When the priest casts his spell, they return to life as unbreakable stone constructs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort;Dungeon Home;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort_desc;Like dwarves, stone giants excel when underground. Though they retain a surface prescence for the sake of livestock, and ease of traders, the castles population is underground. In the cover of darkness, the stone giants toil in secret labor, nurturing the fruit of their artistic harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort_2;Cellar Chiefs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort_2_desc;The strength of any stone giant settlment lays in the fact it is unreachable, or close to it. Under the castle proper, these chambered rooms house the castle entire population, from servants to esteemed masters. Far away from the toil of surface living, some of the finest stone work and masonry is constructed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort_3;Segregated Strata;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort_3_desc;Stone giant society is separated into seven distinct strata, and though no single strata is supreme, there are those who are more prestigious. As such, when exploring a stone giants castle, the first thing to notice is that entire layers of the settlment are devoted to each strata. Servants and Laborers near the top, and masters at the bottom.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort_4;Deep Vaults;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort_4_desc;Hidden well below the earth, the vaults of the castle are where some of the greatest works of art are stored. Heavily guarded, highly selective, and prestigious for any respective lord. The might of any castle is measured in the quality and quantity of it's peoples art.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort_5;Under Kings;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonefort_5_desc;Though from afar, the mountain castles of the stone giants appear quite puny. Not as tall as the lords of men, nor shimmering as the elven princes. These observations are false, for if one is ever allowed into the halls of the under kings, they'd see wonders beyond recognition. Mighty fortresses dug deep into the mountains heart, each layer is a castle unto itself, with seven total defending the fortress.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonecatacombs;Ancestors of Stone;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonecatacombs_desc;The Linjenstein, or "ancestors of stone", is a special room housing the sacred dead of the stone giants. Culturally, death is a spiritual matter for the stone giants. Blessed with long life, those who come close to death, begin the process of petrification. Thus, every "statue" in this room is actually the long deceased elder of the castle. As the castle's population grows, so too shall this room. Grieving families from across the land will come to pay respect to their long dead ancestor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonecatacombs_2;Living Crypts;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonecatacombs_2_desc;For an artisanal people, stone giants are quite morbid with their fascination of the dead. Lining the halls with them, decorating rooms with them, and ultimately creating murals of long dead ancestors. A consequence of this, is that as the castle grows, the dead soon outnumber the living. Becoming essentially one large crypt, the castle takes on the role of sanctuary against necromancy and grave robbers. Many giant families, regardless of breed, will pay heavily to inter their dead in the tombs of stone giants, trusting them to guard them zealoulsy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonecatacombs_3;Catacomb City;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonecatacombs_3_desc;Necromancy, is a paradoxical subject for stone giants. At one hand abhoring it vehemently, the other practicing a specific subgenre of it. The famed stone constructs of their dead warriors, being the chief culprit. Wizards and sorcerers will spend decades debating on whether it is more geomancy, necromancy or a strange mix of both. Still, as the castle grows, the defenders are often joined by these undead warriors. And as for the rest of the jotunbrud, as long as their ancestors are not part of it, their strange cousins are mostly left alone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebarracks;Local Toughs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebarracks_desc;Stone giants hold the highest disdain for brutes and dullards. Of the seven strata, workers are those with no artistic ability, essentially the lowest members in their respective Ordning. As such, they are the undesirables, given the most demeaning and dumb labor jobs a castle would need. Among these are skirmishers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebarracks_2;Lesser Hoodlums;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebarracks_2_desc;Some of these dullards, are not total lost causes. Though they'll never be the greatest warriors of the castle, they are trained constantly in the art of war. And for stone giants, an art is something to strive for.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebarracks_3;Stubborn Students;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebarracks_3_desc;All artistic pursuits in stone giant society, ultimately have a master at the top. The masters are the smallest strata, yet among the most important. Regarding the art of war, stone giants treat combat as humans treat stage dramas. Well practiced, well honed, and displaying peak athleticism;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebarracks_4;Masters of War;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebarracks_4_desc;What were once the hopeless, the useless, the undesirable, have been transformed into proper warriors. Every strike, every swing, is a graceful display of force and dexterity. Essentially dancing upon the battlefield, these giants fight with the nimbleness of an elf, yet with more force than five orcs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonetrainers;Critics Clique;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonetrainers_desc;Critics are one of the seven strata in stone giant society. Wheras other races despise their critics, for stone giants they are important culturally. The masters and disciples cannot improve themselves, without first seeing the mistakes they are inherently blind too. As such, critics enjoy a small amount of power, and the right word can easily motivate a whole castle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonetrainers_2;Orators Ovation;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonetrainers_2_desc;Among the many arts pursued by stone giants, speaking is a little used one. Their castle walls are filled with the grim silence of the dead, with only the sound of whispers and bleating goats depending on which layer you reside in. Still, there are those aspiring orators who practice the art in sealed chambers, perfecting their tone, inflection, and overall demeanor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonetrainers_3;Preachers Pulpit;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonetrainers_3_desc;For a race typically quiet, insular, and hyperfocused, it takes a skilled speaker to rouse them. By building an impressive stage, magnified by the countrysides natural landscape, a priest can easily speak of doom and fire. With the right words, the priest can whip his audience, easily bellowing across the hills and mount for all the giants to hear his call to arms.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonetrainers_4;Demagogues Dream;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonetrainers_4_desc;As in the days of old, when Ostorian sages still walked the land, a new demagogue has emerged. Upon his mountain stage, he speaks with a fiery passion that shakes the very earth to it's core. Dubbed by others as the sermon upon the mount, this demagogue has riled the giants together, under your leadership of course. They fight with intense ferocity, and will easily march into the gates of hell for you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonemasters;Disciples Hall;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonemasters_desc;As one of the most prestigious strata, masters often decide and guide the tribe, even in a castle. Each master is accompanied by a small entourage of disciples, and though they don't practice combat, their high status often affords them the best equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonemasters_2;Throne of the Masters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonemasters_2_desc;Here is where the various masters of the tribe congregate. Rarely is there a situation that demands their immediate attention. Often the traditional topic is the review of a disciples work, and if they are ready for promotion. Such a process of course takes literal decades however, and the masters are not keen on just anyone joining their ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonemasters_3;School of Rock;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonemasters_3_desc;As the castle grows, so too does the number of disciples. Wheras before the master could easily handle up to five students, the sheer number of prospects has demanded a change. Within these sacred halls, whole classes of students follow the word of the master. A recent system, the highly structuralized and regimented schooling has allowed the masters to more easily handle such numbers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonemasters_4;College of Stone;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonemasters_4_desc;The division of the various arts has led to distinct master led schools. It is the greatest honor a stone giant can recieve when their application is accepted. Of course, the decades of schooling, perpetual servitude, and spartan lifestyle, does not deter these prospective artists. To them, to one day be known throughout the tribe as a master is worth any number of sacrifices.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_dreamwalker;Dream Quests;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_dreamwalker_desc;To stone giants, the surface world is immaterial. It's constant changes, neverending chaos, and various people, confuse and unsettle them. Thus, stone giants view this world like a dream. Nothing here is as real as the stoney underworld they live in. As such, occasionally disciples go on dream quests, essentially exploring the world to gain inspiration for their art. Such a thing is relatively accepted, though cautioned against.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_dreamwalker_2;Dreamwalkers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_dreamwalker_2_desc;The steppe, an endless sea of grass and open sky. Any fool who ventures here is doomed to become a Dreamwalker, a lunatic unable to comprehend reality from the dreamworld. Such a fate is usually reserved for banished tribesmen and foolish adventurers. But for tribes settled on the steppe, the unusually large number of dreamwalkers cannot be ignored. These giants view nothing as real, believing themselves inside of a neverending dream.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonelibrary;Ponderers Cubby;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonelibrary_desc;Ponderers are one of the seven strata in stone giant society. Their main purpose is to find and ideally discover new truths, and thus inspiration. This is usually achieved by spending years in meditative study, pouring over small folk books, and transcribing them into biotite sheets. Stone giants will pay handsomely for books of knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonelibrary_2;Scriveners Chore;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonelibrary_2_desc;The less insightful ponderers, are usually given the laborious task of transcribing small folk books into biotite sheets. Usually those with a good and steady hand, the task is still time consuming. Each line of text must first be translated into jotun, and subsequently hand carved into the biotite sheet. A lone sheet, depending on the subjects complexity, may take the whole day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonelibrary_3;Library of Stone;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonelibrary_3_desc;The pride of any tribe, this library houses hundreds of complete biotite folios, with some work going as far back as ancient Ostoria. A consequence of this is that many wizards risk the journey just to study these tomes. Of course, they are usually under watch, and a servant has to turn the page for the puny wizard (each sheet is a large slab of rock). Still, they are more than happy to pay for the luxury.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonelibrary_4;Living Cave;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonelibrary_4_desc;This building is not finished. In fact, the ponderers openly state that it will never be completed, especially not in your lifetime. The living cave is in essence, the ultimate form of stone giant art. Both mural and text, master carvers and painters decorate every inch of the walls with vital pictographic information. Contained within these runes, is all the secrets of jotunbrud society, as far as stone giants know. If a human scholar were to traverse this cave, he would spend years trying to understand its mysteries.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeegshipyard_1;Shifty Sailors;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_verbeegshipyard_1_desc;stone giants are perhaps the least seaworthy people of the jotunbrud. But as commerce and trade flow into the castles port, so too does the necessity of defending it's home waters. As such, the Verbeeg have been tasked with the construction and mainenance of a fleet. Though never as powerful nor as numerous as the great trade leagues, it's enough to deter a few pirates.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stoneroads;Ostorian Road;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stoneroads_desc;Stone giants are an insular race, rarely wanting anything from the outside world. It takes much influence, and a heavy weight in gold to convince the giants to actually build stone roads. But if done, the ruler benefits from some of the best masons, constructing a highway for giants. Stretching miles from their stronghold, these roads are basic in design, yet functional. Where other races use dirt paths and occasional brick, jotun roads are made from massive blocks of stone fitted to allow no cracks. Easily lasting for centuries before replacement.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_aerie;Birds Nest;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_aerie_desc;How did they do it, these insular artists? Deep within their mountain strongholds, one could easily forget that stone giants are not inherently hostile to other creatures. They share their unused caves with bears, allow bats to roost upon their ceilings and so forth. But what shall be a mystery to scholars and sages is how they tamed the mighty rocs as war steeds. Riding upon gargantuan birds, these giants can take to the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_aerie_2;Eagles Perch;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_aerie_2_desc;Legends and rumors, gathered by so called "giantfriends" say that the stone giants never did tame the rocs. That in fact, a humble sage defended its nest from the predation of a basilisk. The giant turned to stone, dying for his noble effort. But the roc never forgot, and over time it's nests and hatchlings continued to be raised within protective arms of the giants ever since.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_aerie_3;Aerie of the Roc;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_aerie_3_desc;A fortress in it's own right, the stone giants have built a massive complex for this legendary bird. Essentially a hatchery, the Roc allows the jotun priests to ferry away it's eggs, said to be guarded deeply within the castle proper. A symbiosis has formed from this, the giants offering food, shelter, and protection for the mighty bird, in return for it's great strength in battle. Nothing is more terrifying than to hear the cry of a thunderous Roc, swooping down upon the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrinestone_1;Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrinestone_1_desc;There are many Gods in the Giant pantheon, or Ordning as it's called. Traditionally, each race recognizes the others patron, but generally contextualizes it to fit their society. Regardless of these religious differences, this shrine in particular honors Annam, the all-father, universal head of the pantheon.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrinestone_2a;Shrine to Obadai;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrinestone_2a_desc;Obadai is the terrestrial son of Annam, the all-father. Progenitor of the stone giant race, his history is muddled with darkness. The legendary artefact "Crown of Obadai" is a necromantic tool capable of summoning and controlling the dead. As well as the practice of ancestor worship bordering on the morbid, and obscene, he is not a popular member of the pantheon. Still, the traditionalist and conservative members of society still revere him, and by building a shrine we better gain their support.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrinestone_2b;Shrine to Skoraeous;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_giantshrinestone_2b_desc;Skoraeous Stonebones is the celestial son of Annam, the all-father. Patron and god of the stone giant race, his teachings are ones of knowledge, beauty, and craftmanship. A peaceful god to many, the few tenets he has are mostly agreeable with other races. The one tenet enforced by his priests, of isolation and meditation, is largely responsible for the races insular ways. Indeed, for jotunbrud society as a whole, they are often labeled as the loners of the species.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###STONE GIANT City###
ct_giantwallstone;Stone Walls;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantwallstone_desc;The local tribe has adopted the customs of the civilized world. Strange even for an insular race, these stone giants have opened their settlement to traders far and away. As such, they've erected large stone walls surrounding the soon to be city.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantwallstone_2;Runic Defense;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantwallstone_2_desc;A local Runelord has blessed the city with his art. Great runes of magical power have been infused into the walls themselves. Not even a charging Auroch could break these walls now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantwallstone_3;Sentinel Dead;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantwallstone_3_desc;Keeping the traditions of their tribal ways, the walls of this city are occasionally adorned by lifelike statues of giant warriors. However, only the ignorant do not know that such decorations are anything but aesthetic. Each statue was once a stone giant warrior, who's sacrificed their life to be one with the walls. Ever vigilant, should the priests call for their aid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity;Peddlers Pit;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity_desc;As a stone giant settlement grows, they typically abandon the upper surface. Not so for this tribe of giants. Instead the surface is host to various peddlers, trying to make their fortunes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity_2;Hawkers Hollow;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity_2_desc;The settlement is begining to take shape into a sprawling city. Though outsiders are forbidden from entering the lower levels that house the giants proper, many of the once spacious buildings have easily been renovated into small blocks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity_3;Traders Towers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity_3_desc;Stone giants as you can imagine dig up a lot of dirt and generally uselss stone, when excavating their own rooms and levels. As such, this city has begun to make use of this excess material with the construction of large humanoid size towers and fortifications.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity_4;Hilly Vendors;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity_4_desc;The rugged terrain surrounding the city is ideal for the stone giants. A small hill can easily house a giants private estate, with tunnels leading into the main complex. As such, these underground houses often entertain rich merchants and powerful lords, safely away from the cities surface hazards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity_5;Mountain Merchants;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stonecity_5_desc;Here is where the city truly shines. The treasures of the earth often reveal themselves easily to the giants, and with it they grow rich and powerful. Easily could a Thane afford a mercenary army, should he wish to indulge his more violent habits.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_merchantstone;Thug Recruiter;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_merchantstone_desc;While civilized hands craft the masterworks which decorate the palaces of kings, someone has to guard the sacred Hall of the Masters. Said duty is often cheaply done, by hiring out local toughs and blackguards to defend the stone giants in their intense labor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_merchantstone_2;Warrior Trainer;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_merchantstone_2_desc;Gold has little value to stone giants aside from it's aesthetic value. Not a race of jewelers, they still hoard them for practical purposes. Often times the gold dug up is used to hire professional warriors, as well as to arm them in times of war. Safe to say, it's an agreeable arrangement for both parties.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_merchantstone_3;Mercenary Lord;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_merchantstone_3_desc;Orc, human, gnoll or ogre, it matters little. Entire mercenary companies have come to the city, enjoying it's neverending flow of wealth for relatively easy pay. Led by (in)famous mercenary captains, the Thane of this city has begun to stylize himself a Lord of War, with certainly enough soldiers to back it up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stratum;Labor Strata;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stratum_desc;Of the seven strata, laborers and servants are the least respected, and most abused. Whether it's manual labor, dull housework, or even braving the wilds for game, these are the lowest of the low. Still, without their vital labor, the lifeblood of the city would cease in total. By properly housing them, and even training specialists, the city will function far greater.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stratum_2;Thinking Strata;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stratum_2_desc;Ponderers, Critics, and Patrons, all are essential for the creative life force of the stone giants. Without their questioning, their musing, and intense study of the classics, the stone giants would never improve as artisans. As such, by expanding their auditoriums, libraries, and galleries, the city prospers culturally.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stratum_3;Creative Strata;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stratum_3_desc;Though it is taught amongst the stone giants, that they are all equal, it is often a great lie. The Masters, with a lesser extant their Disciples, enjoy the most authority in their respective settlements. For such an artisanal people, only the most gifted and prodigious are meant to lead, and as such they demand the most respect. By properly catering to their needs, the city will see an increase in production, and thus profit greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneguild;Crafters Hut;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneguild_desc;Though deep below the earth will the stone giants labor, more open minded Masters have decided to see what the surface dwellers offer. Though the city has long been overtaken by the smallfolk, this stone giant has taken over a shop, offering his services and expertise.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneguild_2;Artificers Shop;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneguild_2_desc;A makeshift shop has formed around the stone giant. Scandalous for other tribes, he has collected humanoid disciplies, teaching his skills and knowledge to any prodigal student, giant or not. Though a Masters will is often unquestioned, this is still a great break from tradition. Consequently, many young artists have flocked to his shop.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneguild_3;Masters Guild;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneguild_3_desc;A veritably small army of hopefuls and humanoid students come and go through this near gargantuan warehouse. A few Masters have joined this once pariah, together opening a guild of craftwork, specializing in their various techniques. It's still too soon to know if this trend will pass on to other cities. What is for sure is that this guild has become quite a powerhouse.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantkin;Runt Volunteers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantkin_desc;Wherever there are giants, you can usually expect their lesser kin to be near. Traditionally, ogres, verbeeg, and the odd troll can be be found working for a giant tribe. And as a tribe grows stronger, so too does its allies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantkin_2;Ugly Kinfolk;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantkin_2_desc;stone giants do not typically employ their lesser kin. As an artisanal people, who despise stupidity and brutes, they often find little use for ogres and trolls that their own servants can't do. Still, Verbeeg often serve as spies, enforcers, and are usually worth a conversation or two.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantkin_3;Lesser Guards;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantkin_3_desc;A line of ogre guards are still impressive, and as the city grows evermore, the need for establishing and reminding the smallfolk who rule requires a heavy hand. Thus seeing marching patrols of ogres are not uncommon on the streets, led by the occasionally intelligent sergeant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantkin_4;Bestial Warpacks;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_giantkin_4_desc;Trolls are by far the most dangerous, and least trusted of the kin a tribe can employ. As such, packs of trolls are often kept chained deep within the cities dank dungeons. But when necessity demands it, these feral packs are taken to the streets to hunt down spies, traitors, and general vermin the stone giants can't reach.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_artvendor;Art Snobs;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_artvendor_desc;As a culture dedicated to artisanal pursuits, selling their work is a foreign concept. Still, they understand the idea of trade, and if any non-giant can convince these snobs to deal, they can stand to make great profit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_artvendor_2;Boastful Braggarts;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_artvendor_2_desc;Many of their greatest works are deep within the earth, sleek statues, mighty murals, and colorful mosaics. It takes a great cajoling of gold, books, and other curios, to get these giants to reveal such treasures.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_artvendor_3;Highbrow Dealers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_artvendor_3_desc;The cities various artisans and crafters have assembled here in this gallery. Though it has taken much bribery and a little extortion, these hopeful giants seek to get profit by displaying their work, in the hopes of attracting smallfolk buyers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_artvendor_4;Parvenu Merchants;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_artvendor_4_desc;Though this city is largely ruled by giants, the heavy flow of trade has led to a middle class of mercantile humanoids. Often acting as intermediarys for their overlords, they often form the base of the cities economy. Of course, these relative upstarts are ill liked by the traditionalists, they are now largely untouchable politically.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneport;Stone Port;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneport_desc;Though by far the least sea worthy of the giant races, stone giants at least understand good architecture. By erecting great sea walls, and wave breakers, the local port has become quite the bastion for weary vessels. Only the greatest of storms and typhoons could wreck this merchant fleet now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneport_2;Stone Pilot;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneport_2_desc;Merchants and sailors alike are often a grumbling, argumentative lot who contend over the smallest detail. As such, docking and leaving port is perhaps one of the most dangerous times for a cities trade. Ill-tempered sea captains and jumped up pirates often quarrel over who gets the right of way, blocking trade with their dispute. As such, a stone giant must pilot these unruly dogs, with force and heavy club as needed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneships;Verbeeg Sailors;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneships_desc;Any city on the water inevitably hosts a fleet of some description. Though nowhere as powerful as the frost giants, nor as invincible as the storm giants, stone giants understand the basics enough to let others do it for them. As such, the Verbeeg clans that have come to live in the city have taken to the maritime trade, providing ships, sailors, and a good club for battling pirate scum.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneships_2;Ogre Marines;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneships_2_desc;As the city grows, so too must it's fleet and naval ambitions. Verbeegs are competent enough sailors, but in times of war, boarding parties must be repelled as well as launched. Thus enters the ogres, often cajoled and bribed to be on board, their main duty is to beat any scum who steps onto the ship.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneships_3;Giant Admiral;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_stoneships_3_desc;Behold the Master of the waves, a stone giant who has conquered his fears of all things water. Though not as great a commander as other races, this giant admiral is certainly capable enough of directing the fleet from sea to shining sea.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mastershall;Labryinth Layers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mastershall_desc;To the unaware, a stone giant city often appears the same as any other surface city. This is the critical mistake, for the stone giants often dig deep into the very earth. For an artisanal people, they live rigid and hierarchal lives deep below in shadowed halls and ancient craftshops. Here the Masters rule as kings, with various houses and guilds forming around them. Only the Thane, most artistic of the giants, resides on the bottom most layer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mastershall_2;The City Below;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mastershall_2_desc;The city below is often a secret from the surface citizens. Only true giants and trusted kin may enter these labryinth halls. The truth however is that those the surface citizens see are often the undesirables, or more accurately, labor strata. Composed of servants and laborers, they reside on the uppermost layers, and interact the most with the surface world. The Masters and other nobles live deep below, comfortably away from the cities often curious ways.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mastershall_3;Under Mountain;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_mastershall_3_desc;Like a fortress stacked upon fortress, this city complex delves deep into the mountain. Giants of all varieties mingle with their stone cousins, while surrounded by great works of art. Layers leading into layers, with some touching the upper underdark, the city is truly a hive of both crafters and soldiers. The Thane of this city wields great power, and some say his ambition goes even beyond the heart of the mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ostorianroad;Ostorian Road;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ostorianroad_desc;Stone giants are an insular race, rarely wanting anything from the outside world. It takes much influence, and a heavy weight in gold to convince the giants to actually build stone roads. But if done, the ruler benefits from some of the best masons, constructing a highway for giants. Stretching miles from their stronghold, these roads are basic in design, yet functional. Where other races use dirt paths and occasional brick, jotun roads are made from massive blocks of stone fitted to allow no cracks. Easily lasting for centuries before replacement.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ostorianroad_2;Toll Stations;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ostorianroad_2_desc;The local Thane reasons that if any non giant dares use a jotun road, must pay a toll. As such, large guard houses sit at key distances throughout the great network of road, manned typically by ogres with the odd stone giant sergeant. The benefits are obvious, as ogres are quite convincing in parting gold from squishy merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ostorianroad_3;Dream Walkers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_ostorianroad_3_desc;Though the guard houses are effective in collecting gold and other booty, the roads themselves are quite dangerous for non giants. From bandit kings, roving orc bands, and the odd monster, the land is quite inhospitable despite the Thanes best attempts. As such, Dream walkers, who were once the outcasts of society, have returned. Wandering the great stone roads, they often slay monster and brigand alike, so lost are they in the dream world. Effectively a cheap patrol, the Dream walkers have carved a niche role in giant society.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Frost Giant Tribal###
tb_frostcamp;Makeshift Camp;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostcamp_desc;Tribes of frost giants are rarely sedentary, preferring adventure and war instead of more agrarian pursuits.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_icecamp;Winter Defense;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_icecamp_desc;The never ending winterland of the far north is inhospitable to near all races. That is of course not the case for frost giants. Where others shiver and die, they thrive and grow. Already, the ice and snow form a mighty natural defense.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_icecamp_2;Ice Walls;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_icecamp_2_desc;Frost giants rarely consider fortifications, for their way of life revolves around glorious raids. The longbeards among them still recognize it's long term use. As such, with the ample labor of slaves and winter wolves, great ice walls now surround the camp.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_icecamp_3;Fairy Ice;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_icecamp_3_desc;The far north, with it's great tundras and neverending icey plains, is home to dangers far and wide. Besides yetis, winter wolves, and the lone dragon, the terrain is also dangerous. With devious magic, essentially quicksand has formed around the camp. Careless spies or besiegers can easily sink into the snow, never to be seen again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_bonecrafter;Bonecarvers;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_bonecrafter_desc;Adorning the body and armor of any frost giant is various trinkets and charms. Typically made of bone, these baubles are carefully crafted with an eye for quality. More prestigious warriors usually hunt great beasts and monsters to turn into their personal ornamentation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_bonecrafter_2;Leatherworkers;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_bonecrafter_2_desc;Frost giants hold a culture of strength, war, and conquest. But between raids and long winters, even the simplest brutes have hobbies. Often taken from tanned skins and furs, leather making is quite crucial for their society. Anything from tents to clothes, typically came from some elk or yeti.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_bonecrafter_3;Carpenters;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_bonecrafter_3_desc;Wood as you can imagine, is quite sparce in the frozen north. Any chance a frost giant can get a hold of wood, they'll take it. But for a race that abhors fire, the wood is mostly used for finer things, such as plates, mugs, and the odd boat. Whenever they get enough lumber however, they typically use it for constructing the Jarls manor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_krotter;Ugly Bovines;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_krotter_desc;Krotter, are perhaps the scraggiest, mishapen beasts of burden to ever grace the realm. Like a cross between yaks and camels, with hair like a buffalo, these bovine creatures reside in the far north. Often preyed upon by any creature that can eat meat, the Krotter is often protected by giant tribes and other kin.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_krotter_2;Fecund Herd;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_krotter_2_desc;You may ask how such pitiful creatures survive the savage northlands. The truth relies entirely on this species fecundity. Essentially, given their high fertility, ability to birth calfs twice in the same year, and capacity to grow twice as fast any cow, means they're prized herd animals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_krotter_3;Rod Spoils;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_krotter_3_desc;Rod and Kvit, livestock and materials, is how frost giants categorize their spoils from raids. Krotters, of course living in the far north, where the giants rule, often change ownership. A young giant will often boast he can steal five Krotters from his neighbor, while another says he'll do ten. In the end, all that truly happens is the strongest amongst them (the Jarl) has the largest herd.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mammothherd;Hairy Pack;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mammothherd_desc;The great beasts known as Mammoths typically roam the subartic lands of the far north, from the High Ice to far Sossal. An intelligent beast, the Mammoths rarely tolerate anything, though the frost giants have endeared themselves to them. Often accompanying the herds as shepherds to sheep, nothings more terrifying than to be in the war path of their stampede.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mammothherd_2;Shaggy Herd;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mammothherd_2_desc;Mammoths are gentle creatures, ill-suited to war, or it's hazards. Most frost giants are lucky to get milk from their lumbering pets. Still, as the herd grows, Mammoth bulls will either be gelded or butchered. Thus in the rare event other giant tribes mingle, ivory and pelts occasionally change hands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mammothherd_3;Wooly Rampage;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_mammothherd_3_desc;There's very few creatures capable of bearing the weight of a giant. In the south, humans construct great archer towers off the back of elephants, but in the far north, frost giants ride into battle upon these great wooly steeds. The impact of which can shake the very earth, if there's anything left to tell the tale.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_thyrmtemple;Temple of Thyrm;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_thyrmtemple_desc;Do not be fooled by their outward appearance. Though they may be cruel raiders, they are not dumb nor stupid like hill giants. In this sacred hall, Thyrm the god of frost giants, is given honor and praise. The skulls of great beasts and weapons of fabled warriors adorn this temple, as if it were Thyrms private collection.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_thyrmtemple_2;Hall of Jarls;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_thyrmtemple_2_desc;Beyond Thyrm's treasure room, lays the hall of Jarls. Warrior chiefs and wise men, the room is decorated with the visage of long dead giants, immortalized as stone statues. Some were villains, others noble in spirit, but what they all share in common is the burden of leading their people.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_thyrmtemple_3;Hall of Heroes;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_thyrmtemple_3_desc;Great champions and warriors are immortalized in this room. Young giants are raised upon the very stories of these long gone heroes. Many a giant dreams of having his name and deed recorded into the runestones of this most sacred hall. Needless to say, only the greatest of giants ever joined this elusive club, though often posthumously.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostships;Lonely Pier;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostships_desc;Only the storm giants can surpass the frost giants in their love and mastery of the sea. The reason for this is quite simple, for the wide open sea is the greatest adventure of all for young giants. With monsters from deep below, wind that cuts like a blade, and the prospect of great fortunes ever on the horizon, sailing the ocean has always chilled a frost giants heart.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostships_2;Chilly Dock;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostships_2_desc;The swing of hammers and sawing of wood fills the air around this building. This is perhaps the only labor frost giants respect and admire. Though they enjoy their baubles and gaudy trinkets, shipmaking is the pride of any tribe, with longboats often being the lifeblood of the giants. No slave or dishonored kin is allowed near these sacred docks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostships_3;Frigid Wharf;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostships_3_desc;When given access to the sea, frost giants often spend most of their daily life around the wharf. As the tribe grows, there's little shortage of sailors and adventurers, eager to brave the open sea. Slaves, cattle, precious metal, and of course rare gems, are not uncommon after the arrival of a raider fleet. Indeed, given a choice a frost giant would rather spend their days sailing and reaving than any other duties.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostships_4;Iced Port;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostships_4_desc;Often the only source of wealth this far north, this port has seen constant raider fleets come and go. Little doubt that the Jarl of this tribe has grown rich and powerful from such daring raids. A scourge of the sea, many of the smallfolk fear the sight of the longships upon the horizon. Pity any poor souls, who happen to become slaves to the giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostfeast;Wrestling Bouts;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostfeast_desc;The Ordning of the frost giants is composed of strength and martial pride. Everything else is either in the pursuit of strength, or simply abandoned. One such way of showing strength is wrestling, typically during bouts of drinking and other revelry. This constant need to prove oneself often makes fearless warriors, content to fight to the last in glorious battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostfeast_2;Skalds Saga;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostfeast_2_desc;History is often synonymous with heroics and the sagas. Young children often grow up hearing the stories and tales of distant ancestors. This appreciation for history, often affords some respect for the Skalds, the bardic warriors of frost giant society. In battle, they often sing tales of long gone warriors, of victories won, and defeats endured.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostfeast_3;Flyting Words;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostfeast_3_desc;Nothing is more sacred to a warrior than his pride, and nothing else does he excel at, than the brandishing of word. When frost giants become a certain degree drunk, and the winter night is unreasonably warm, they begin what is known as Flyting. A highly formal display of insulting and mocking a rival, which if done correctly, allows the insulted to challenge them in combat, or face disgrace, and loss of status.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostfeast_4;Winter Revelry;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostfeast_4_desc;There's good reason frost giants enjoy visiting their distant kin, (fire giants excluded) and that is to drink and revel. A favorite are hill giants, who often enjoy the company, and the excuse to feast anyway. The drinking of mead, the cold meat, and hearty songs often make up a frost giants life when not at war. A Jarl who provides his people a proper feast hall is most respected, and in return he can expect a fearless, if hungover army.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slavewarrens;Thrall Pit;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slavewarrens_desc;Frost giants are naturally cruel, and care little for what they call "Rod" loot. Living or dead, the thralls will be used regardless. Their blatant disregard for the smallfolks comfort, is no better exemplified by housing them in deep pits, barely covered by a thin tarp to keep out the elements. In times of war, large mass of thralls are forced into the battle, for no better reason than to drain the enemies arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slavewarrens_2;Slave Warrens;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_slavewarrens_2_desc;As the Jarl raids and expands his tribe, inevitably there will need to be changes in how the thralls are housed. Instead of deep pits, they are kept in a sprawling warren of rat-like tunnels, unsanitized and bereft of any comfort. To the surprise of even the giants, there seems to be some people surviving in that bleak den of horrors. Whether by foul magic, or strength of will, it matters not.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostmanors;Rural Homestead;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostmanors_desc;Frost giants as a people are quite immune to the hazards of the wild and it's harsh weather. This doesn't mean of course they can't enjoy comfort. Typically, as a giant grows in age, and his prospects of going up the ordning fade, one begins to homestead. This is the delicate period of becoming a longbeard, where the giant no longer eagerly participates in the youngs boasts or revelry. Instead they sire children to do it for them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostmanors_2;Rustic House;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostmanors_2_desc;With enough wood and lumber, the frost giants can move away from their tent and open sky ways. The first to adopt such comforts are the Weirdners, or magic users. Shamans and Runecasters, their powers come not from strength, but through intelligence. In an Ordning based on martial prowess, they earn their priviledged status by aiding the warriors during times of war. Many a great battle was won by their ability to enchant the army.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostmanors_3;Nobles Manor;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostmanors_3_desc;Nobles are the elite warriors and shield brothers of the frost giants. These are no mere hooligans or youths seeking out a name. Instead they have earned their right and power via great feats of martial strength and awesome boasts. Their manors are large, often sitting above or away from the tribe in a well defended spot. One of their many responsibilities is to gather the lesser warriors in times of war, and make ready for the Jarl.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostmanors_4;Jarl's Hall;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_frostmanors_4_desc;The Jarl is the strongest warrior amidst a tribe of warriors. A lifetime of battles, raids, and daring feats, has earned them the right to stand tall amidst giants. Their home is decorated with rare gems, precious metals, and of course, trophies from beast and man alike. The Jarls hall is often a congregating point for youths, shield brothers, and nobles. With but one blow of the halls horn, the whole tribe can be assembled under it's regal roof.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_northmen_1;Northern Tribesmen;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_northmen_1_desc;The savage barbarians that populate the far north are similar in culture to frost giants. Valuing strength, honor, and booty, it isn't surprising to see human tribes allying themselves with a rising Jarl. As for the giants themselves, the barbarians often earn some begrudging respect, with their berserker rage and battle ferocity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_northmen_2;Northern Chiefs;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_northmen_2_desc;The Jarl has cemented his power with the various barbarian chiefs in the province. Whether by skilled diplomacy, excessive bullying, or simply a promise of the loot, the human tribes of the north have pledged their axes to the giants cause. Even now, a great host of beast and man is being marshalled by the Jarl.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Frost Giant Castle###
ca_icepalace;Frost Fort;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_icepalace_desc;Frost Wizards, hated worshippers of the Tanar'ri lord Kostchtchie. An interloper of the Ordning, he offers frost giants the secrets of Frost magic. It is with this power the Jarl has erected a great ringed fort of ice around the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_icepalace_2;Ice Borg;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_icepalace_2_desc;With great magic, the Frost Wizards have constructed a mighty castle of ice. Foul winds scream from deep below, the moon shines nevermore upon it's battlements. Any true giant knows that this borg of sorcery is filled with things most demonic.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_icepalace_3;Winter Palace;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_icepalace_3_desc;At first, the frost giants were quite stubborn. The old ways were too stifling, too focused on honor and revelry. Now the Jarls palace has become a den of savagery. Giants taking fell lovers, foul beasts haunting the open tundra, and the rage of demons boiling their warrior blood.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostfort_1;Stoney Borg;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostfort_1_desc;Frost giants typically are adventurous, seminomadic, and rarely sedentary. That is until you find the few tribes composed of longbeards. These giants believe that they must prepare for Fimbulwinter, when frost giants take over the world.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostfort_2;Doomspeakers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostfort_2_desc;Long dead has Ostoria lain, gone are the armies of Giants and their kin. But whispered among the longbeards, those frost giants old enough to know, that Annam will return, and Thyrm his loyal son, must bring upon Fimbulwinter. To that end, they prepare for long sieges and a great war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostfort_3;Warriors of Fimbulwinter;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostfort_3_desc;The young tribes do not understand. To them they even dare call cowardice, though you know better. The end of man will come, and we must prepare for the greatest battle Faerûn has ever seen. Our borgs are stout, our warriors mighty, and most of all, we are prepared to answer Thyrm's call.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostwall_1;Addled Guards;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostwall_1_desc;Frost giants are poor guards, only a step or two above hill giants and ogres if not for their intelligence. They are a wild, free spirited kind of being. They drink, they revel, and most importantly slack off. Though it was only recently the longbeards built this castle, they have yet to drill proper discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostwall_2;Red eyed Sentries;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostwall_2_desc;The longbeards, often a century or two old, have long learned the measure of temperance and discipline, a quality missing in the young folk. Once in a while a guard or sentry sneaks a mug of mead, or takes a sip from their wineskin. There's still a long road to get these warriors ready for Fimbulwinter.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostwall_3;Grumbling Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostwall_3_desc;A strict schedule of training, sentrywork, and sleep is quite dull even for the doomsaying longbeards. As such, Thyrmsday is often a day of rest, which merely means drinking and reveling. Thankfully the borgs mead hall is grand enough to accomodate the whole garrison.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_jotunheim_1;Tribal Villages;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_jotunheim_1_desc;Used to traversing the open tundra, hunting wild elk and the like, settling down in one place year round was often avoided for survival's sake, but this has changed. A small village (by giant standards) has formed around the Jarl's fortress, often a raucous and rowdy den of raiders and nomads.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_jotunheim_2;Fortress Town;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_jotunheim_2_desc;As the demands of the castle grow, so too does it's surrounding village. Furs, timber, and metals all flow into the town, bringing precious wealth to the province. If wise, the Jarl will encourage this further, for no army runs on charity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_jotunheim_3;Little Jotunheim;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_jotunheim_3_desc;A far sight from the days of old Ostoria, this castle has still attracted many giants. So much in fact the thunder of their steps can be heard miles out. For the first time in centuries, a freehold has emerged, with giants the ruling class, and all other smallfolk second best.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfpacks_1;Beast Wranglers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfpacks_1_desc;Outsiders may mistake giants as particularly druidic, or at least of some ranger skill. This is false, as the way frost giants "tame" beasts is abject cruelty and brutality. Either starved, beaten, or worse, the monsters you see running before a host are more scared of the giants than they are of death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfpacks_2;Wolf Pack;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfpacks_2_desc;There are of course a few exceptions. Wolves hold a special place in the hearts of frost giants. Perhaps sensing the innate hierarchy of strength, whole packs are often easily tamed, without so much as a club or fist. Much terror has been cast into the hearts of the northmen when they hear a horn blow, and the howls answer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfpacks_3;Beast Masters;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfpacks_3_desc;Beast masters are the individuals responsible for raising and "taming" the various beasts frost giants keep. Often the most senior of wranglers, the master's main task is the raising and training of the various wolves, much like a human hound master. Easily distinguished in battle by the packs surrounding them, and their near naked attire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfpacks_4;Heralds of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ca_wolfpacks_4_desc;From the heart of the frozen north, there are tales of winter wolves, capable of swallowing a man whole. In truth, these beasts come from the mythical land of Jotenheim. Intelligent, capable of speech, and malicious, they are the bane of the north. Their very breath freezes all life, and much joy do they take in the torment of cornered prey.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_meadhall_1;Meadhall;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_meadhall_1_desc;Nothing more does a frost giant love than battle and valor. Second to that is his mead and the joys of drinking. A meadhall is both a congregation of fellow warriors, and a place to rest. Here, tales are spun, victories recounted, and defeats drowned. No true Jarl could let the people go without mead, and by building a fine hall, prosperity is sure to come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_meadhall_2;Skaldic School;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_meadhall_2_desc;More an alcove for drunks to sing and cajole one another, no one can deny the mere fun of having the Skalds sing their merry tunes. Songs of woe, of love, of battles great and old, are told here. It can not be stressed enough the appreciation, especially from longbeards, over their oral traditions. By encouraging this, the warriors often fight with a smile on their lips.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_meadhall_3;Trophy Hall;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_meadhall_3_desc;The mead hall is decorated with some of the finest treasures and weaponry from enemies great and terrible. It is a great sign of pride, often inspiring the warriors to go out into battle. Shields covering the wall, spears holding the roof, and banners won hanging above the Jarls table.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_meadhall_4;Ritual Revelry;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_meadhall_4_desc;But of course, nothing makes the giants happier than the mead itself. Any giant worth their salt keeps a great undercroft stocked with their finest of barrels. For how could they revel without good mead? A revelry is one part festival, one part competition. Boasts are made, jests told, and more often than not, wrestling comes next. A Jarl who keeps the party on time, can always expect more warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_manors_1;Private Homesteads;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_manors_1_desc;There are some traditions which survived the transition from tribal to castle life. Manors, often housing the finest of warriors and their families, are one such tradition. Effectively nobles, they pay small tribute to the Jarl, and in return the Jarl offers protection and glory when they amass for battle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_manors_2;Noble Houses;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_manors_2_desc;In any castle, the ruling elite are those warriors with grey in their beard. Having seen decades of warfare and raids, they sit comfortably at the top of frost giant society. Their manors are usually surrounded by small farms, where smallfolk thralls tend the fields. Do not believe them soft however, for war is never far, and their axes are as sharp as their wit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_manors_3;Frosty Mansion;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_manors_3_desc;In the far north, where the mammoths roam, frost giants have taken to the art of domestication. And in those snow-cloaked castles, nobles have taken to riding these wooly beasts as men do horses. Now they offer their lord a heavy contingent of stampeding beasts! Of course, the private herds they keep do well supply them with meat, cheese, hide and ivory.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_manors_4;Northern Knights;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_manors_4_desc;In herds uncountable, the warriors of this tribe ride out to battle. Atop their shaggy steeds, a frost giant becomes a machine of war. Capable of trampling villages, corralling large swathes of thralls, and marching huge distances at a swift pace. These Northern Knights have little challenge, save for the odd dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostarmy;Northern Terror;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostarmy_desc;Of course, a life spent training and drinking hardly gets a warrior prepared for real battle. As such, the longbeards, often assemble hosts of frost giants to go plundering. Unlike their more free spirited brothers, this is done purely for experience's sake.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostarmy_2;Horns of War;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostarmy_2_desc;Constant raids and incessant skirmishes, all in the name of preparing for the inevitable battle to end all battles. The results are often questionable, but what is never in doubt is the abundance of volunteers for such excursions.;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ca_frostarmy_3;Winter's End;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostarmy_3_desc;After years of battles, what was once a gangley horde of villains, has become a disciplined troupe. Heavily armored in precious metal, with weapons magical, they are the elite of the elite. Shieldbrothers they are, and they shall spearhead the end.;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ca_frostmoot;Family Reunion;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostmoot_desc;Giants as a whole are a solitary and lonesome people. Most families number no more than 10, if that. Before the Jarl united their people, giants were either wanderers, or half-savage from their new environment. By building a great stomping ground, giants from across the land can make the yearly pilgrimage to find lost relatives and old friends. Of course, if the Jarl makes some money at the same time, who's going to complain?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostships;Lonely Pier;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostships_desc;Only the storm giants can surpass the frost giants in their love and mastery of the sea. The reason for this is quite simple, for the wide open sea is the greatest adventure of all for young giants. With monsters from deep below, wind that cuts like a blade, and the prospect of great fortunes ever on the horizon, sailing the ocean has always chilled a frost giants heart.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostships_2;Chilly Dock;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostships_2_desc;The swing of hammers and sawing of wood fills the air around this building. This is perhaps the only labor frost giants respect and admire. Though they enjoy their baubles and gaudy trinkets, shipmaking is the pride of any settlement, with longboats often being the lifeblood of the giants. No slave or dishonored kin is allowed near these sacred docks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostships_3;Frigid Wharf;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostships_3_desc;When given access to the sea, frost giants often spend most of their daily life around the wharf. As the tribe grows, there's little shortage of sailors and adventurers, eager to brave the open sea. Slaves, cattle, precious metal, and of course rare gems, are not uncommon after the arrival of a raider fleet. Indeed, given a choice a frost giant would rather spend their days sailing and reaving than any other duties.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostships_4;Iced Port;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_frostships_4_desc;Often the only source of wealth this far north, this port has seen constant raider fleets come and go. Little doubt that the Jarl of this tribe has grown rich and powerful from such daring raids. A scourge of the sea, many of the smallfolk fear the sight of the longships upon the horizon. Pity any poor souls, who happen to become slaves to the giants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_remorhaze;Polar Worms;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_remorhaze_desc;Polar worms are enormous creatures with the body of a centipede and worm combined. Horrifying monsters to many, to frost giants just another beast to tame. Surprisingly, such a monster is tameable, not just by giant standards. Raised from an egg, these creatures can be taught to be guard animals, often hiding under snow and ice to surprise would-be spies and thieves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
