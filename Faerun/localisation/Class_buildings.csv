###Druids###
tp_druid_circle;[Root.DruidLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_desc;[Root.DruidLoc]s are places of great mystic power, tapping deep into the laylines of the earth. From young shepherds to Archdruids, as long as but a single one lives, the circle will as well. By constructing this building, great magic can be worked.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_2;Secluded Den;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_2_desc;In this hidden lair, deep in the wilds of the world, is a small cache of books, parchments and minor food stock. A meager waystation for traveling druids and rangers, it is often where the Circle rests before their clandestine meetings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_3;Minor Circle;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_3_desc;Druidic circles are not a fixed location, but rather a collective group. As time moves on, more successful groups eventually acquire membership of fae and sylvan creatures. With such power, the circle is better able to influence the region.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_4;Druidic Village;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_4_desc;What was once a secluded den of druids, has grown into a whole village. Whether living in great tree homes, or in fungal groves, these druids have become great guardians of the wilds, often hosting smaller fae and injured animals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_5;Menhir Stones;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_5_desc;With the growth of power, the circle has decided to settle in one location. Often atop great sites of natural power, the druids begin erecting a great Menhir circle, marking the outlines of their territory. Often large stones, they are marked with magical runes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_6;Altar of Nature;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_6_desc;As the Menhirs rise, an altar dedicated to one of the many deities of nature is built. Whether to peaceful Mielikii or wise Titania, the altar is the pact, a symbol of their loyalty and dedication to the forces of nature. As a result, the Circle is heavily guarded.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_7;Great Circle;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_druid_circle_7_desc;A great complex of standing stones constructed in a pattern magical, surrounds a sacred alter. On full moons, a host of Druids, led by the Archdruid, discuss matters temporal and spiritual. From lonesome trees to the heart of the wild, their power is felt everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_1;Full House;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_1_desc;Druids are the natural guardians and healers of the wild, from deep forests, to misty caves. Often times their services are needed not only by "civilized" races, but those of the wild. Healing the sick, nursing the young, and so on. A tribal druid often has a small entourage of loyal creatures, who never "left the house" so to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_2;Secluded Dens;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_2_desc;It doesn't take much to find a den, though it's another to come out of it alive. Druids are the great peacekeepers between the wild and the tribe. Often teaching tribe members the signs of an occupied den, what creature lives there, and how best to avoid it. Often times, Druidic symbols are merely the warnings of "dangerous bear".;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_3;Sacred Lairs;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_3_desc;Certain lairs are host to more magnificent or powerful creatures. From mighty bears, to noble lions, the Druid often pays special visits, as an emissary of the tribe. In times of great peril, such as war against mutual enemies, these noble beasts will lend their assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_4;Fey Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_4_desc;Druids are not just friends to animals, often they go to great lengths to forge ties to the fewild, whether it be a sylvan tribe or a disapora of korreds. Still, the feywild is often a perilous place for mere mortals. A druid who intentionally tangles their tribe with it's politics risks much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_5;[Root.DruidLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_5_desc;As an Archdruid of this [Root.DruidLoc], the line in the sand has been drawn. No longer a mere shaman or witch doctor, this servant of nature has thrown themselves with forces beyond mortal comprehension. Mystical beasts and fey creatures easily answer the call to war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_6;Servants of the Fey;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_6_desc;As the Archdruid consolidates their power, the tribe is barely recognizable from what it once was. Sylvan couplings are common, fey beasts stalk the land, and the Archdruid has physically changed. The question becomes, does the Archdruid serve for noble intent, or the whims of Fey Lords?;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_7;Sylvan Lord;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_beastlairs_7_desc;A great host of Druids and Rangers have pledged themselves to the Archdruid, a true Sylvan lord. As master of the [Root.DruidLoc], legendary beast serve as their generals, and even Eladrin courtiers try to curry favor. What mystical thoughts, go within their mind? What mysteries still elude them, and what by the Gods may stir this monster to wrath?;;;;;;;;;;;x
hospital_herbalist;Humble Shaman;;;;;;;;;;;x
hospital_herbalist_desc;Even the weakest Druid knows much of herbs and poultices. Though many worry over the nature of war and balance, this humble Shaman simply contends themselves working the hospitals garden, producing a few goodberries. Coupled with their respectable knowledge, they can do much good for the province.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hospital_herbalist_2;Friendly Herbalist;;;;;;;;;;;x
hospital_herbalist_2_desc;After much time and gold, the Shaman has been able to properly stock themselves with rare herbs and tools. Now a proper herbalist, with even a few assistants, they can now serve the hospital better than ever, with magical might and a healers touch.;;;;;;;;;;;x
hospital_herbalist_3;Goodberry Groves;;;;;;;;;;;x
hospital_herbalist_3_desc;No man or woman, however mighty, can feed the world alone. By spending much time in research, this Druid has blessed the province with the most mystical of all creations. A goodberry grove, a large patch of land capable of naturally producing such holy fruit. Famed to heal most injuries, as well as nourish the weary.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_druids_oasis;Paradise of the Sands;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_druids_oasis_desc;A legendary feat of both magical and druidic might, a great Archdruid has brought life to the desert. Waters flow shimmering sweet under the suns stare, while some pilgrims claim it heals body and soul. Regardless of the claims, this great Oasis is not only a pilgrimage site, but a source of great wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Rogues###
ct_thieves_guild;Thieves Guild;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_desc;Any city, from fair Neverwinter, to sultry Calimport, has a Thieves guild. The difference between those cities and yours, is the fact you actively engage with it. Here cutthroats and thugs can be hired for cheap, while criminal masterminds orchestrate their various rackets.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_2;Sewer Highways;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_2_desc;The larger, and older the city is, the more extensive their sewer system is. From a single manhole, one could theoretically find a path straight to the rulers palace. This is of course heavily utilized by the guild, often staching secret hideouts and lookouts throughout.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_3;Smugglers Portal;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_3_desc;Despite being the ruler of this fair city, there are certain products of yours outlawed in foreign cities. Whether slaves, fine hashish, or monsters, the demand still exists in those lands, and you're just the rogue to provide it. Establishing connections between our guilds, we can easily smuggle in the goods.;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ct_thieves_guild_4;Branching Enterprises;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_4_desc;There are many different businesses and trades your guild dabbles in. From simple rackets, smuggling, murder, and more, the need to properly organize has emerged. Now dividing the task between your captains, the guild has different branches entirely centered on certain crimes. Just be aware they are quite ambitious...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_5;Shadow Army;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_5_desc;As open lord of the city, your authority has enough challengers from scheming nobles and undisciplined troops. But the underworld that touches every city is a ferocious beast few rulers have ever slain. Until you of course. From a veritable army of thugs and cutthroats, you've monopolized all crime underneath the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_6;Spy Network;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_6_desc;Foolish rulers often leave their skullduggery with a simple courtier. You on the other hand manage it all under secret codesigns, symbols and the odd thieves cant. The city is a nest of vipers, each one eager to turn on the other, while you sit at the top perceiving all. A maid leaving early, a soldier blinking twice, all a message only you know.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_7;Underdark Holdings;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_thieves_guild_7_desc;If you thought the streets of the poor district were dangerous, you've seen nothing yet. The underdark is the final frontier of crime and anarchy. As one famed Drow said, "the surfacefolk always look in all directions except below". With secret outposts and guarded enclaves, traders as foreign as Deep gnomes and lethal as mind-flayers tend to visit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_rogues_den;Dark Connections;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_rogues_den_desc;As the master of your own criminal organization, it makes sense to have your own private enforcers. Quick, fast, and a cut above the rest. These Blackguards aren't cheap, but they can easily work subtler missions than the odd thug.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_rogues_den_2;Shadowed Figures;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_rogues_den_2_desc;Dark tunnels and secret paths always have eyes watching. In the comfort of your office, trained Assassins are but a moments call away from storming the room. Such measures are necessary when dealing with fellow Patricians, who are anything but safe to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_rogues_den_3;Secret Bunker;;;;;;;;;;;x
fp_rogues_den_3_desc;In the worse case scenarios, it's often best to squirrel away the family through the tunnels into a more secure position. Of course, in peaceful times, this bunker is the heart of your criminal activities, brimming with Assassins, Blackguards, and the odd monster. It's never easy being on top.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_highwaymen_1;Highway Bandits;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_highwaymen_1_desc;The merchant guards your tradepost hires, carry a few qualities the local lord may not desire. Under the cover of night, these riders stalk the roadways, slaying any lone merchant or traveler. The best part, is that these curs safely abscond with the loot behind the tradeposts walls by day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_highwaymen_2;Robber Knights;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_highwaymen_2_desc;Your tradepost has begun to form a reputation of murder and evil. As a result, you've ordered the construction of a secret hideout, far yet near enough for your robbers to continue their nightly prowl. Hopefully the local lord buys into the rumor of Robber Knights...;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_highwaymen_3;Robber Baron;;;;;;;;;;;x
tr_highwaymen_3_desc;What began as a small hideaway has grown tremendously into a little keep. There, your Robber Knights have elected amongst themselves a Baron, a Blackguard warrior of some infamy. The local lord surely is aware of the growing threat, though the evidence does not lead to you...;;;;;;;;;;;x
