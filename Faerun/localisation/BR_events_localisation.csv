bio_alustriel;Biography of Alustriel;;;;;;;;;;;x
bio_alustriel_desc;Alustriel is a powerful mage, being one of the Chosen of Mystra and one of the Seven Sisters. She is known for her love and devotion to her people, something especially unusual for many people who hold political power. Therefore, she is extremely popular in Silverymoon, and most of her subjects would do anything in their power to prevent any harm from happening to her. She is considered a wise and fair ruler, but she does not hesitate to be ruthless when needed (i.e. in diplomacy);;;;;;;;;;;x
bio_bruenor;Biography of Bruenor;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_silverymoon;Silverymoon;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_silverymoon_desc;Silverymoon is often dubbed "the Gem of the North", for it resembles and emulates the lost elven city of Myth Drannor in many respects. It is one of the few civilized places in the middle of the rough and untamed wilderness that is the North of Faerûn. It has a rich cultural life and is renowned as a meeting place for all races that are morally inclined towards good. Even the occasional drow with good intentions (most notably the famous ranger Drizzt Do'Urden) could eventually find hospitality in the city of Silverymoon. The city's population was 40% human, 30% elven and the rest were mainly half-elves, dwarves, halflings and gnomes.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_sundabar_desc;Sundabar is described as "harsh and treeless." The city itself is very fortresslike. The streets are cobbled and most buildings are made of stone and are three stories tall. The only greenery to be found in the city was the occasional windowbox garden of herbs. Connected to the surface by steep passage, the Undercity is home to most of the dwarven population. Almost a third of the city's population was dwarven, half was human and the remainder was mostly gnomes and halflings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_luskan;Luskan;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_luskan_desc;Luskan, also known as the City of Sails, is a port city at the mouth of the River Mirar on the Sword Coast North.

stop_adventuring;Stop adventuring;;;;;;;;;;;x
go_adventurnig_desc;You can leave the burdens of rulership aside and go adventuring. It is advised to take a small retinue and go explore Faerûn - the different regions offer different challenges;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring0desc1;As its name implies, traveling through the Sword Coast is hazardous. Though cities, towns and castles dot the landscape, this is a wild and dangerous land to travel in for the most part. There are dangers, but there is also adventure and treasure to be found aplenty here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring0desc2;Once part of the wood elf Kingdom of Earlann, the High Forest is now a dangerous place where few outsiders dare to tread. There are no roads, only game trails, and outsiders will find few friends here. There are plenty of monsters to fight, but this area is not known for its treasures.;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring0desc3;Traveling through the Savage Frontier is only for the foolhardy. Monsters lair in caves, old haunted elven ruins dot the wilds and tribes of orcs - and worse - ambush travelers on a regular basis. You should remain constantly on guard.;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring0desc4;Only the desperate come to Icewind Dale at the edge of the world. The frozen landscape can support few people, and outside of Ten Towns, the strong rule mercilessly. Ice trolls, goblins, giants and violent tribesmen roam the tundra.;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring0desc5;The Silver Marches is a beautiful - but wild - region of Faerûn that is only slowly being tamed. Several strong walled cities such as Silverymoon, Sundabar and Everlund provide safety, but outside their walls only the bold dare to tread without a strong escort. There are many treasures to be found here, however.;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring0desc6;Evereska is an elf city hidden in a mountain valley. It's beauty is such that rumours say many mortals only stand and stare in awe, unable to move, upon first seeing it.

adventuring3B;Let's get out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring4desc;It seems there is a series of caves up ahead. Your scout reports that they seem to go deep, and there are signs that they are inhabited, though he didn't go too far in.;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring5desc;It seems there is a camp of some kind of monsters ahead - your scout didn't get too good a look, but they seem humanoid, and they don't outnumber your party by too much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring6desc;It seems there is a fortress up ahead. It is not on any maps, and the 'art' on its walls seem to indicate that either monsters or evil-doers of some kind are using it as a base.;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventuring7desc;Your scout staggers into camp, delirious, and nearly dead. He manages to gurgle something incomprehensible before falling over. #He has left a trail of blood that anyone can follow, unless you want to make a run for it, of course...;;;;;;;;;;;x
