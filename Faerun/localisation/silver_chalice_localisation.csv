knight_order_silver_chalice_desc;The Order of the Silver Chalice is a knightly order dedicated to Siamorphe the Noble. This group is primarily made up of Tethyrian nobles dedicated to locating lost members of noble families and restoring to power those who would govern with the interests of the common people at heart.
