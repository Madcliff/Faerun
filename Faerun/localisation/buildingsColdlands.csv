####Vaasan Castles###
###ÄNSI
ca_vaasan_fort;Badlands Shelter;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasan_fort_desc;Vaasa, our home, is a land of pain. Raiders from the mountains, devils in the bog, and the curse of Zhengyi lingers within us all. Even the land rejects us, with her cold tundra and barren steppe. But we hail from a hardy people, and for once we hold the future in our hearts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasan_fort_2;Rugged Camp;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasan_fort_2_desc;Vaasa only thaws for a brief matter of weeks, turning the whole plain into uncrossable marshland. Crops barely grow fast enough to feed our people, and ever vigilant against the goblin and giant threats we must be. Our people are ill-equipped, but always count on settlers coming to each others defenses.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasan_fort_3;Settlers Fort;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasan_fort_3_desc;For the longest time, Darmshall was our bastion, our defiance against those abyssal and foreign. It was famed heroe Gelgar Talonguard, who defied the Witch-King for ten long years. Though we be poor fighters, the land has bred warriors true, that'll fight until the very end.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasan_fort_4;Grassland Barons;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasan_fort_4_desc;It was Gareth Dragonsbane who slew the Witch-King, but it was the people who endured the goblin and giant raids. From nomadic warriors we hail, and horsemen we be. The open plains of Vaasa must be fought with speed and tenacity, if we ever wish to unite this land.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasan_fort_5;Lords of the Plain;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasan_fort_5_desc;No longer will Vaasa be a land of bogs and demons. Our warriors ride free, from Mirror Lake to Palischuk, the land patrolled with bow and axe. No longer will we suffer another Witch-King, who treated us as cattle and slaves. We take our destiny, from the tops of glaciers to the mines of sunderland.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_settlers_1;Free Settlers;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_settlers_1_desc;Vaasa is not a land rich with metal, or more accurately, easy metal. All the good mines are owned and guarded by dens of goblins, or worse. As such, the best we can equip are long pikes, and bowmen. Nontheless, pike and bow has always been a ready defense when raiders come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_settlers_2;Militia Men;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_settlers_2_desc;There are many small homesteads out in the plains and bogs of Vaasa. Often times these brave settlers must be alert, and ready to flee in the face of a superior force. By training these settlers, we can better prepare ourselves for war, as displaced families make way to the keep.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_settlers_3;Signal Defense;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_settlers_3_desc;With but a mighty horn, our castle can call out to the various freefolk in the province. We are not warriors bedecked in shining metal, but fast do they answer the call.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanmine_1;Surface Mine;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanmine_1_desc;Metal, precious metal. With this surface mine, a far cry from those of Bloodstone, we can begin to arm our soldiers properly. Though many fear the mine playing out, the results are immediate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanmine_2;Metal Outpost;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanmine_2_desc;We've dug deep into the earth, as far as the rugged country will go. Our warriors wear fine plate, their swords shining, and many smiths fill the air with the ring of hammers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanmine_3;Mountain Hole;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanmine_3_desc;Men are not as deft as dwarves, nor as crafty as kobolds. But with stout labor, we will reveal the secrets of the earth. This mountain we will conquer, just as we conquered foes of flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanmine_4;Gem Mine;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanmine_4_desc;The mountain is ours, with every pick and ring, precious metal has given new life into our Kingdom. For once, the armies of Vaasa are a force to match the southern realms. May all realms tremble!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanorcs_1;Runty Folk;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanorcs_1_desc;Vaasa has a peculiar culture to outsiders. With so many enemies against them, there is a strange brotherly bond between those who share this burden. Half-orcs, a race often looked down upon, are seen as kin here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanorcs_2;Rugged Militia;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanorcs_2_desc;When the Witch-King ruled, he destroyed Palischuk. In the aftermath of his defeat, Half-orcs braved the ruins to find their new homeland. Long since, Vaasan half-orcs have been part of our history ever since.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanorcs_3;Tough Boys;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanorcs_3_desc;Trained with pike and bow, these warriors are a step above. When war is on the horizon, these boys are strong enough to swing halbards and pikes like mere twigs. Woe to the knight who fights against us.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanorcs_4;Vaasan Defenders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasanorcs_4_desc;Half-orcs and humans, living in peace, in a land ravaged by war. Outsiders may call us backwards, perhaps savage. But what we are is alive and ready. Our walls are well defended, so much that any army will fall before it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasantown_1;Wastelands;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasantown_1_desc;The wastelands surrounding any castle are inherently hostile to southern ways. Typically, castles attract folk who build around the fortification. With the constant threat of raids and war, most towns never really develop.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasantown_2;Free Riders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasantown_2_desc;The main way of travel in Vaasa is by horse, before the winter melt and the heavy snow. Any supplies or trade must be done swiftly, lest a settlement starve during the long winter. As such, brave merchants hire on free riders to accompany them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasantown_3;Convoy Traders;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasantown_3_desc;Being able to outride most of the hazards native to Vaasa makes life easier. Successful merchants soon begin amassing a large host of warriors, able to ride the distance from Bloodstone to Palischuk in no time at all. Of course, any rider who loses their horse is often doomed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasantown_4;Caravan Trains;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaasantown_4_desc;Guarded by a host of riders, many equipped with bow and axe, means few creatures dare to come near. During the precious few weekes when the ground is firm, large caravan trains march from castle to castle, bringing precious foodstuff and tools.;;;;;;;;;;;x
