title_runecaster;Runecaster;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_runecaster_desc;Runecasters are one of the most sacred of titles a giant can hold. Regardless of race, those who've mastered Annams greatest gift are immediately welcomed in any giant tribe. Of course, said giant must prove their mastery, often a task taking decades, or even a century at most.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Flavor for Hill giant culture###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_lesser_Glutton;Lesser Glutton;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_lesser_Glutton_desc;Gluttons are one of the most culturally significant members of hill giant society, ranking just below the Chief and Priest. Their main job is to keep the food stores in a tribe well stocked.;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_fetcher;Fetcher;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_fetcher_desc;Fetchers, as the name implies, fetch things. Typically serving the Gluttons and Chief, the fetchers are but another cog in the wheel of hill giant society, albeit more important than some.;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_gourmand;Gourmand;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_gourmand_desc;Hill giants are notorious omnivores. They'll eat elves, orcs, and carrion. As such, they don't have the same delicate taste for cuisine as the smaller races. Still, Gourmands cook the food, which is nice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_mouthgrolantor;Mouth of Grolantor;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_mouthgrolantor_desc;A Mouth of Grolantor, is both pariah and living saint. What started as food poisoning, has led this giant onto a road of madness, with ritual starvation, gorging, and the reading of vomit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
###Frost giant culture###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_skald;Skald;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_skald_desc;Skalds are the bards of Frost giant society, for lack of a better word. During winter nights, they sing the sagas, great tales of heroes long gone. Much of a tribes oral history is kept by these wanderers, as such they're afforded great respect.;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_shieldbrother;Shieldbrother;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_shieldbrother_desc;Outsiders will simply see an old, brutish warrior. But to frost giants, Shieldbrothers are a cut above the rest. Grizzled by war, hardened by battle, and the last to fall, these champions are sure to join Thrym in death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_shieldsister;Shieldsister;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_shieldsister_desc;When wolves stalk the camp, or in the heat of battle, a frost giant never ignores those of strength. As such, Shieldsisters are those warrior women who've earned the respect, nay, the right to die by their brothers side.;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_alecup;Ale Bearer;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_alecup_desc;Frost giant tribes, can politely be called a machismo-filled society of warriors constantly jockeying for dominance and social prestige. There are some non-martial positions of respect of course, but being the Ale Bearer is not one of them. Seen as weak, pathetic, and often an outcast, this giant is responsible for filling everyone's flagon during the many feasts and revels.;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_beastmaster;Beast Master;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_beastmaster_desc;Here is where many of the frost giants more terrible and fearsome beasts become "tamed". In truth, the Beast Masters main job is to bully and abuse the monsters into obedience. The greatest prize however, is to capture a dragon. Pity such a poor creature for its future torment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
