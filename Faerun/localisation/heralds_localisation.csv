heralds;Heralds of Faerûn;;;;;;;;;;;x
heralds_desc;The Heralds of Faerûn are a quasi-independent group of historians and heraldists that take on the responsibility of recording the coats of arms, flags, standards, shields, badges, mottoes, symbols, and sigils of the nobility of Faerûn. Over the years, they also became the foremost authority on courtly courtesy, inheritance, precedence, genealogy, correct armature, and general history. Their impartiality and neutrality earned them the respect of nearly every nation, kingdom, city-state, mercenary company, clan, and tribe in civilized Faerûn.;;;;;;;;;;;x
